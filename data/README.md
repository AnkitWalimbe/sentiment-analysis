# Data Instructions

This project uses the **Amazon Fashion Reviews** dataset.  
Due to size constraints, raw data is not included in this repository.  

## Download
You can download the dataset from:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitwalimbe2596/amazon-fashion-huggingfacedataset

Specifically, use the Amazon_Fashion.jsonl file.  

## Usage
- Place the downloaded file into `data/raw/` and rename it as: 
Amazon_Fashion.jsonl

- The notebook will automatically load from:
data/raw/Amazon_Fashion.jsonl


## Notes
- Processed data files (if generated) will be stored in `data/processed/`, which is also ignored by git.
- Only small, derived artifacts (like sample CSVs in `/reports`) may be committed.
