Very good quality.,positive,positive
As beautiful in person as it looks here! I received so many compliments on them!,positive,positive

Nice shirt with good fabric. A little tight on the chest but manageable.,positive,positive

"Fit as described, great looking and warm",positive,positive
"While they are decent tank tops they are definitely not compression tank tops... They &#34;compress&#34; about as much as a cotton wife beater... I ordered  extra small based on another reviewer saying to go down a size... Even if I went down 3 sizes (which couldn't be done xs is the smallest option) they still wouldn't work as a compression top... They are pretty thin... They aren't a total loss though... The material didn't feel too bad. I chose the black, white, and grey option so I do have a variety to match with other clothing. The fit isn't horrible when you first put them on... However they don't fit the same after hours of wearing them... I couldn't imagine using them at the gym... If you sweat they're really gonna stretch out... And if you are looking to contain any kind of jiggle... Forget it... I gave two stars because they aren't the worst thing I've ever purchased... I like the T shaped back... It makes your back/shoulders look pretty badass... But the price wasn't that great for regular tank tops... For compression tank tops it would've been a phenomenal price... But as I've already said they're definitely not compression tank tops...",positive,positive
"I bought these boots and I really like them. I'm giving them 4 stars for two reasons. One is a problem and the other is what I consider a design flaw.<br /><br />The problem is that I've found so far is the heel fell off one time. I just popped it back on, not thinking I should set it with gorilla glue, or something of the sort. It hasn't popped off since.<br /><br />The design flaw is that, while yes it does have a zipper, that's negligible because you have to lace them EVERY TIME you wear them. These should have had grommets running the full length of the boot, so you can easily slip them on and off via the zipper, and only adjusting the lacing when necessary.",positive,positive
No me gusta,negative,neutral
I have small ears and the jewelry itself was pretty but the bar was too short and the jewels themself were wayyyyy too big for the upper part of my ear.,positive,positive
Great product and Wife loved the gift box. Post is a little too long but otherwise beautiful.,positive,positive
"Nice lightweight, a little bigger than I thought but nice",positive,positive
my friend loves this,positive,positive
"I got the velvet burgundy version of the dress.  I normally wear an 18/20, but ordered the XL as I keep buying clothes that are too big. The dress is a little tight through the bust, but looks really nice overall. I love that it's a stretchy velvet and therefore nice and warm. I can't wait to pair it with some black heels and go to our fancy Valentine's date night!",positive,positive
Would easily give it 5 stars if it weren’t WAY too long.  These will drag the ground on a 5’10” gal so all y’all tall girls GO FOR IT!!,positive,neutral
I thought it was a 3 pack with 3 different colors ...why would I need 3 of the same color?,neutral,neutral
The dress was too sheer and the top gaped open too much.,positive,neutral

"This dress is super cute and comfy, BUT, they sent the wrong color.<br /><br />I read the other reviews, who said the same thing about receiving the wrong color and decided to order anyways. Shame on me. Shame on the company, too.",negative,negative
"Nice material, it was bigger than I expected but I just tied a knot in it on one side. It looked nice",positive,positive
Ordered this for my brother in law as he is always in suits. The product came in well packaged in plastic and the color is a beautiful stainless steer silver high quality. It looks more expensive than what is listed so for sure if you are looking for a tie pin this item is for sure the one for you,positive,positive
"Put my prescription on em & they fit good, had to tweek them a bit. Everyone comments on them. I got the small ones cause the bigger ones seemed too big.",positive,positive
Lightweight and not bulky. Love this!,negative,positive
My teenage daughters love that shorts but the tops were a bit too cropped for what they like to sleep in.  Very soft and comfortabe and great price.,positive,positive
"I love the fact that not only are they have style but I don’t have to keep bobbing my head up and down between what I am working on and watching tv. These are the perfect reader. Comfortable to wear, just needed to adjust the ears a bit to fit better. And more importantly is the value that you get. I mean, three multifocal readers for the price is amazing. So much cheaper than buying trifocals, yet these are what exactly what I need glasses for.",positive,positive
I was so excited when this arrived. It looks very pretty in person but the darn thing broke as I was putting it on. Glad I only spent $3 on this thing. I'm going to attempt to put my own clasp and chain on it because it really is pretty and I want to wear it.,positive,positive
"hollywood bound, well made , not cheapo shoes,",positive,neutral

Sleek and comfortable.,positive,positive
I like the shape,positive,positive
"This is a Beautiful peice. Years ago, when I first became interested in the metaphysical properties of minerals & metals, I would carry obsidian in my pocket to help with grounding sometimes erratic moods. At some point I must have realized that I am sensitive to Many influences around me. I can certainly understand how this peice makes a great Mala. When I first saw it--and then tried it on--I found it Very Uplifting. Whatever your beliefs may be, you can't go wrong with this lovely peice.",positive,positive

Very good product,positive,positive
Fit just right and very comfortable,positive,positive
I love the length!!,positive,positive
I have not received this yet but from the reviews it should fit well being other people who bought it said it is a generous fit. I love the style and the knit looks very warm and stylish..it looks like very good quality...it comes in many many colors so may get one more.,positive,positive
"I bought this for my best friends birthday because we both love the Percy Jackson series. It arrived looking just like the picture and I'm thinking that it'll last a pretty good amount of time. The only thing is that the leather chain is a bit shorter than I expected, but I'm sure she wont mind. I could also tell that whoever was shipping this cared in the safety of their product because it was wrapped well and a few layers. In the end I'd call this buy a win and I'm sure so will my friend.",positive,positive
"Too big, the strap on the bottom is a loose fit. Huge waste of money for this garbage. Now I have to re-think my Halloween costume. Thanks for nothing!!",positive,negative
I purchased for my daughter and she loves them! She can put them on herself and the quality is great. Great price as well!,positive,positive
"I was absolutely thrilled when I ordered this jacket.  It's comfortable, flattering, reversible, etc.  Adorable to wear around the barn and then for your evening errands.  Washes beautifully.<br /><br />Be careful with the soft side...your velcro gloves, phone holder, etc will snag it horribly.  So, as it wears out I use it with the smoother side showing.<br /><br />Then, I wore it in the rain.  There is nothing even remotely water resistant about this jacket.  I was soaked.<br /><br />Overall, cute jacket.  Not practical.",positive,positive
Bought it as a gift for my Sooner wife.  She's been wearing it every day since.  Score!,positive,positive
What is that ? It does not look right.,neutral,neutral
It's so nice. I haven't dunked it in water or anything but I have gotten it wet on multiple occasions it works fine after but while it's wet the screen is a bit less reactive which is completely understandable. The setup is a bit complicated I haven't even changed it since time changed 😂 it's worth it once you set it.,positive,positive
Bought it for my daughter in law for baby shower. She looked so beautiful in it very soft,positive,positive
Works good for the beach,positive,positive
"The fabric is shinier than I was expecting but it's still beautifully made. It has little pockets for filters on the inside and I'm constantly getting compliments on it. I absolutely love it to pieces. The best part of it is how it's adjustable, so it can fit my face as well as my partner's.",positive,positive
Very cute summer dress for the price. If you need extra room at the top go up a size. I normally wear a LG on top but am reordering an XL.,positive,positive
Luv it!! ❤❤❤,neutral,neutral
Actually really beautiful in person  small and dainty,positive,positive
This well and it was made well and it's cute,positive,positive
Cute but did not fit. I could not get into my size. Maybe a large would have been better. Great customer service. Refunded me and allowed me to keep item!,positive,positive
"This strap had only about 1/4 of the material that I was expecting. So if you are looking for a heavy, thick cut leather strap you will be disappointed. The vendor provided me a full refund which is why I adjusted the rating to 3 stars from initially 1 star.",negative,negative
Great Christmas band!,positive,positive
Happy Teen,positive,positive
"Nice shirt but has, no give, no stretch. It’s Perfect for under a jacket. Ordered a XL fit is good.",positive,positive
"I wore this shirt home from the hospital after having my daughter. When I delivered I was 189 pounds and I decided to get a size L. As you can see I still have a lot of belly in the picture but it fit great in my opinion. It’s very soft and comfortable, one of my favorite go to shirts!! Now that I have lost some weight it’s a great oversized shirts with leggings.",positive,positive
"It was good, but the sticky didn’t last very long and fell off throughout the time I wore it.",positive,neutral
Ordered for my daughter. Great fit,positive,positive
Cute item was beautiful just as described,positive,positive
"Loved everything about it, price wasn't too bad and for it you get a quality title belt. Just as good as a figures toy co. replica. Stay away from title belts only 2MM thick and around or under $100, there terrible quality, spend the extra money, its worth it.  That's what I did with this belt and I couldn't be happier.",positive,negative
"I finally went out and used the mask, and literally couldn't breathe. The fabric is soft and comfortable, BUT when you inhale the fabric sticks to your nose making almost imposible to get air. It was really scary and desperate. Maybe if you have a regular mask under, and want to use this as ""cool"" look on the outside. For me it was a waste of money (I got two)",negative,negative
Love this beanie!!!,positive,positive
It's just a little bit bigger than a normal fitted hat...but still is good.,positive,positive
"Wow,  blown away by these. So comfortable, stylish, and way better than expected. Shippers fron China so i was optimistic. Quality was superb. S9ne bigger name brand undies made of Modal are pretty pricey. These were half the price and shipped 7 pairs all different colors. The fit is definitely a trunk so if you don't mind the shorter leg, go for it. Im sliding and gliding with ease and they tend to keep away moisture. I live in PHX so i needed to switch from cotton aka ball scraping chainmale. Would recommend!<br /><br />Pros<br />Cheap, lightweight, modal-poly blend, comfortable<br /><br />Cons<br />Would like more design and color options.<br /><br />I'd list washing or care instructions but i just got them so i can't comment just yet. Treat it like any other poly-blended golf shirt or what not. Wash cold, dry low no heat.",positive,positive
this ring is way prettier in person but has started to tarnish already,positive,neutral
"Soft material, but would size up for lose fitting vs. clingy.",negative,neutral
"Nice fabric, good stretch",positive,positive
"I was so excited about this dress but it doesn't look like the picture at all!! The tie dye is really inconsistent, it was almost completely black in the front but white in the back and it was really oddly long. It wasn't flattering at all either and the loose part on top doesn't hit at the waist like it does on the model. Don't waste your time ordering this one.",negative,negative
The fit is great and the material is good quality. It was a good buy,positive,positive
I like the way look but pretty disappointed on that the description saying it blocks blue light and it dose not block blue light which is important to me personally. Driving at night with the oncoming lights is what is most important.,positive,negative
Perfect fit. Nice COTTON weight. Pop of color I was looking for!,positive,positive
Exactly as presented,neutral,neutral
"This is super cute. I normally wear plus size 1X and ordered XXL and it was a little big which I don't mind. Perfect length, just past my booty so I can wear it with leggings.",positive,positive

"I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. I'm not sure if I'll be keeping this. It might be too short for tge conservative wedding I bought it for. But its very pretty, stylish, well made, and flattering. It is short though. I'm 5'6&quot;, &amp; about 145. I wear a 6,7,8, or a 28 in jeans. I wore a Medium. Its a touch baggy in the waist. I wear a 34D.",positive,positive
"I thought I loved these from the start, even with receiving them with a deep scratch on the heel and straps not tight enough. BUT as the day wore on, the ball of my left foot really started to hurt, I shrugged it off as to wearing new shoes with no padding. I inspected the inside sole to find a nail head poking out! That's what was irritating my foot. I was highly upset and had to put a band aid on it just to get through the work day.",negative,negative
I believe I have found my go to for reading glasses.  I have purchased many many others in the past & these fit the best & I can see well!  I am in front of my computer all day & the light blocking is fantastic.  Highly recommend!<br />Update: Both pairs have broken. The bottom of each lense is held with fishing wire. That wire gets loose & the lenses fall out. They both have now broken. Wish I could return them but unfortunately I can't. I do not recommend them at all.,positive,negative
Love the colors. Will be perfect weight for spring/fall. Got 2xl and fit great. The sleeve are a little long but I prefer that. Soft material.,positive,positive

I love this brand of bathing suit so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. This is my third purchase from them! All of my suits from Sea and Sand are a perfect fit and they are a cute style while still being modest. I bought my usual dress size and it fits exactly as it should. Highly recommend!,positive,positive

Serves its purpose for putting a tile on my car key chain after losing my overpriced car key....only two wishes to improve it wish the strap was longer so I could wear on my wrist and wish the screw didn’t come a loose in my purse almost lost my tile maybe some loctite will hold it,positive,negative
These are a good pair. They look exactly as the picture. My shoe size (flat heels) is normally 7. But the panda sandals tore in about 3 weeks of delicate indoor use on hardfloor. So I do not know if it is quality or the show size but they look incredibly cute and feel really warm.,positive,positive
Beautiful and great value.,positive,positive
"Cute pins, standard enamel pins.",positive,positive
I returned because the crystals were sparse. Beautiful frame. The company was so gracious to deal with in returning them.,positive,positive
"Love these shoes! I'm on my second pair of Circas.  I wear them daily and have a very physical job that requires me to constantly be walking/standing. After 6 months they were still very comfortable, but were starting to show some wear (I have the white with black smilies) so the white isn't so white anymore (although a magic eraser works amazing at taking dirt and scuffs off these! ) anyway I love my smilie shoes so I have a fresh pair for work and my not so fresh pair are hanging around for comfortable yard work shoes.",positive,positive
Perfect cute and soft. My baby loved it.,positive,positive
Scratch easily and way too wide. I thought these would be cool and they look great when you get them but they scratch easily and they were gigantic on my face. My soccer team called me alien when I wore them which is always fun.,positive,positive
Awesome and amazing. So comfy,positive,positive
Liked them.. trendy and don’t  cost an arm and a leg❤️‼️,positive,positive
Not the best fit.,negative,positive

"Although The North Face is a good and reputable brand, this model is not good.  There is very limited space, and the edge that meets your hip is sharp so it is a little painful to use.",positive,positive

As a guy these earrings are pretty cool. Give me a edgy feel without looking too feminine. Get a lot of compliments.,positive,positive
"Super cute , however they are little deceiving in the picture shown on amazon looks like it has black or darker color on it.<br />It don’t just the way the picture was taken.<br />I still like them but I have to find a new bead to match them.",positive,positive
I get lots of compliments from this top.  It isn't restrictive like a lot of the chiffon tops can be.  It is a little shear in appearance (for my liking) but a little cami underneath and it takes care of it no problem.,positive,positive

"I have four pairs in different colors. I wear them everywhere (okay maybe not to a funeral) because they are super comfy, look great and have enough coverage to go commando, but still show off my sexy thighs! I might even try wearing them to work out one day - but until then, these are still my fav baking chocolate chip cookie shorts!",positive,positive
Best mask I got so far on amazon tried different ones so I ordered the 5 pack the next day so I’ll see how it goes with the 5 pack plus it is welled stitched a big plus for me holds up better that way,positive,positive
Great bathing suit! Looks great on me and fit was as expected.,positive,positive

"I love the colors in this dress, matches the picture perfectly. I almost returned this dress because the strap part where it tied was not in the front as pictured, so the dress was not fitting right, plus the waist was tighter and more clingy in the waist than I like.  I went back to the picture and figured out I needed to move the strap from the shoulder to the eye hole in front, so the top part fits great now, very adjustable. Im 5’4”, 125 lbs and ordered a small.",positive,positive

"This dress is super comfy and looks cute! It is not as long as I had hoped or as pictured, and I do wish it didn't have ""hippy soul"" on it, but otherwise I'm very happy with it! Color is true to picture. (Blue) I got a medium, am 5'5"" & 155lbs.",positive,positive

This necklace is woven with cute pearl beads that look very beautiful.<br />Features<br />The chain is not very long and comes just below the neck.<br />It looks simple yet elegant.<br />There is chain extension behind to fit the necklace as per one’s neck size.<br />It can be used for a casual wear for work or for parties and  festive occasions too.<br />The price is reasonable for a such a nice necklace.,positive,positive
"Well, if you want cotton this is it.  I purchased both short sleeve and long sleeve choices.  They washed okay and fit okay but looked just okay.  Nothing really bad about it but just okay.  I had previously purchased the Escenchel brand and these just can't compare BUT the Escenchel doesn't have any cotton in it either.  I'll wear the Escenchel out and keep these for around the neighborhood.<br /><br />Update: Having worn these I have increased the rating to 4 stars.  These wear very nicely:  the slight amount of stretch is great, don't wrinkle much at all while wearing, hangs nicely and quite comfortable.  The muted colors kept these from getting all 5 stars.  Although the colors depicted are pretty accurate, 5 stars would mean I love it and I don't.  Like the dresses as a garment but just wish the colors weren't so drab.",positive,positive

"I really liked the color of these lenses, but they didn't even come close to fitting properly. Big disappointment.",negative,negative
"The watch is nice, but there's a big problem with the band for people with smaller wrists. The first inch of the band is very stiff, so it won't wrap around my wrist comfortably. Another issue with the band is the clasp has somewhat sharp edges that makes an indentation on my wrist. I end up returning this watch and got a version that has a silicon band that was much better, although the clasp is the same so the problem persist in that part of the watch.",positive,positive
Love this ring and the beautiful colors,positive,positive

"These are SO cute, they look absolutely adorable on my little girl.  She says they're comfortable and I have a pair in adult size so I can tell you that the leather on these is remarkable with almost no break-in period at all.  They do seem to run a bit large, but that just gives them room to grow, adjust your lacing and wear thick socks, you should be OK.",positive,positive
Just a little too big but my granddaughter loves it.,positive,positive
Keeps my glasses close. Does it's job.,neutral,neutral
Perfect. Just what I wanted,positive,positive
"The shorts were way too short for my liking, so I wear it with a different, longer pair that I already owned. The top is adequate for keeping &#34;things&#34; embraced during water exercise.

"I fly frequently and my legs swell up like balloons. Very uncomfortable. Besides the discomfort, I am always looking for a way to reduce my risk of DVT. These socks arrived just in time for 36+ hours of air travel and they were ok. I wore them on a transatlantic flight and when I removed the socks I still had some swelling. The swelling did go away quicker than normal, but after another 10+ hours of flying, the socks did nothing to relieve the swelling. I wore them anyway and will continue to do so for the reduced DVT risk, but these socks only reduced my swelling by maybe 20%. Ill keep looking for the perfect pair, but until then, these will do.",negative,positive
"I love this purse. It's so unique and cute and I get compliments on it everywhere I go. The picture doesn't really do the holographic effect justice, it's more colorful and pretty. However, the first day I carried it, the holographic piece panels began falling off. I wore this as a cross body bag, and the pieces on the edge that touched my hip began falling off. The edges for the other pieces come up as well, as if they aren't adhered properly. I tried gluing them back, they don't really stay any better that way.<br />Basically its really cute but won't necessarily hold up.",positive,positive

"This season, these pants have become my favorites. The wale pattern of the corduroy is unique and expensive looking. The cream color goes with everything. The legs fit so well.

I was unable to change that but the length was perfect with boots.",positive,positive

"I would not consider this a blouse, but more a sleeveless tshirt.<br />I didn't like the material, feels and looks cheap. Design is not as pretty as in the product description. The top is more like a boxy and shorter that in the description photos.<br />I think I got confused by the size chart, and maybe that's why is so big on me . But that not change the fact that the top I received is not as pretty as the one in the photos.<br />The only thing I like about this top is the v neck design. Probably if I take in a bit on bot sides, I'll be able to alter to fit my body and actually wear it.",negative,positive

"I haven't been able to find an attractive chain holder for my reading glasses in my local area so I ordered these.  The price is certainly right for three chains and they are pretty enough, but there is no difference at all between the rose gold and the regular gold color.  They are a good length and come with both clear and silicon grippers to attach to the glasses.  UPDATE: The plating wears off fairly quickly and then the chain turns your neck green!",positive,positive

"The ring is okay. You can barely see the cross or the prayer written on it without some type of light shining close to it. On the picture the writing looks very dark, however it is very light and you can barely see it when wearing the ring.<br />The picture I provided looks like the engraving is dark but it is not at all. I ordered it to wear it as a thumb ring and it rotates around your finger as described and I like the fact of wearing the Lord's prayer on my finger but I would like to at least see it when I look down at my finger 🥴.",positive,positive
"These are actually great for everyday wear - the legs are not riding up at all. They are the soft and smooth feel typical of micro modal. There is not a lot of room or support in the groin area, but it's not at all unconformable. The David Archy briefs and MeUndies are both thicker and I think a bit nicer and shaped a bit better, but these are still really comfy.<br /><br />I knocked off a star for the tag, however. Why - Why? After about an hour of enduring the feel of it right above the intergluteal cleft, I pulled out a seam ripper and removed it. There is no place scratchy tags anymore in modern clothing.",positive,positive
"The initial disappointment with this product came with the discovery that the chain portion in the front is attached in such a way that it cannot be moved or adjusted. In the pictures, it seemed to indicate that it could be used as a partial choke chain (yes, we’re that kind of people, and no, it wasn’t bought for a dog). Aesthetically, it’s fine, but after only a few hours’ wear, the material on the back caused my wife’s neck to itch and break out. We’ve since replaced it with something more suitable, but this is really only good for a short time, maybe for night-clubbing, not for daily wear or any activity that would bring it in contact with sweat or outside moisture.",positive,positive
I bougjt these conpression sleeves because they were cheap. I went into the purchase thinking that if they werent all that great id only be loosing ten bucks but i was actually suprised by the quality. They seem tk be really well made and for 10 bucks i see no need tk buy any of the other more expensive brands. Like im curious is to how the manufacturer even makes money off these. There a little tight but that is my only complaint so far. Im really impressed with these and will be buyong these again in the future when they start to wear down,positive,positive
I always have issues with length on dresses. I read a few reviews saying that the dress was to the floor for some people. They were the same height I was. So I figured it was going to be the same for me. It wasn't......I had to add 5 inches of fabric to the bottom to make it hit the floor. I am 5'8 and 125 lbs. I bought a size small. It fits everywhere else. Just way too short.,neutral,positive

For the price this looks nice, however the metal necklace charm bends easily with even the slightest touch and it feels very brittle to the point you believe it may break at any second.

"I ordered 2 of these dresses.  The one in wine (by EverChic) and the other in black (by Verdusa) were made by 2 different companies.  The black has not arrived yet.  I am 5'8"" 170 and ordered the XL.  I am usually a 12 bottom 14 top.  The XL was very tight when I expected it would be loose and relaxed fitting.  The material is not as stated in the description. The dress I got was 65% polyester and 35% cotton.  There was no stretch, the arms were long and very tight fitting.  I returned it as soon as I tried it on and hope the back dress made by Verdusa looks more like the picture.  Amazon needs to assure more consistency in their sellers and how they list their items. I am glad to have prime because I would be pissed if I had to pay to return this!",positive,negative

"Purchased 0g and 2g. The tapering at the ends made it impossible to fit without damaging my ear. They are not true to size. The 0g had tapers almost as big as a 00g, while the middle was more true to a 2g.  These are stone, and keeping that in mind theyre not exactly like the ones in the picture, but similar. The 0g colors were different than the 2g colors, so they dont necessarily match perfectly.",negative,positive

"I really love this tank top! It is really soft… like a favorite worn in teashirt. I was really surprised with the quality of this tank.

I ordered a bunch of other colors of this shirts and LOVED them but when I ordered the ombre one it was a completely different fabric- like athletic shirt material. Totally different and super deceptive and awful quality. Completely dissatisfied with this product.,positive,positive

"While the print is cute and I was getting compliments all day (although I don't quite know what fireworks have to do with Christmas...This dress has several shortcomings. The Fabric itself is comfortable, but too thin (since I got the cream color Christmas theme) you could see EVERYTHING underneath. I had to change into white everything underneath. (white bra, white camisole...which is weird for wearing a dress btw, white panties, and a white slip.) Since I had to wear a slip I was constantly having to adjust and smooth it out so I didn't have big creases and folds. I work in an office and am having to get up many many times in just a short period...making for a lot of awkward pulling and tugging.<br />The fit is perfect up top...but a little small in the waist area....I am not large, I am average build....but I do tend to hold my weight in that area....making it slightly unflattering. Soooo, I had to break out the SPANX....nobody likes having to wear those ALL DAY.<br />While I was able to overcome the shortcomings....It took just a little too much effort than I like. (as a momma of a three year old...and a husband that isn't home in the mornings, getting ready in the morning is difficult enough as it is.) Between the camisole, the spanx, and the slip....it was just too inconvenient for me.",positive,positive

"A gift for my girlfriend, these sunglasses are great except that they are NOT polarized. The price tag should have been a clue, but since it says it in the item title, I thought I'd give it a shot. So if polarized lenses are something you absolutely must have, these sunglasses are not for you.",positive,positive
"Love these earrings! Every once in a while I get the urge to have my hair dyed a darker color underneath or have a strip of blue put in. These earring give that effect without the commitment. They are pretty long, I thought about cutting them but I’m trying to grow my hair out so I left them. A few weeks later and I feel they are a great length. I purchased the blue ones and then ordered the maroon. Love them!",positive,positive

"These mirrored glasses seem well made, are very light weight (.66 oz), comfortable to wear and come with a nice, soft, non-leather case. That's the good part.<br /><br />The lenses are very dark. It makes things in shadows harder to see. Didn't notice any polarizing effect. Worst of all, light shining on sides of face reflects off the inside of the lenses making it look like there’s something on the lens obscuring view. Very annoying.<br /><br />Minor note: Under product description, manufacturer says, “TIPS! To avoid damage . . . use clean water and 'included cloth' in case.” No included cleaning cloth came with these glasses.",positive,positive

I was disappointed to find a seam that wasn't sewn all the way but it was such an easy fix that I stitched it & moved on with the photos.  I would've given this top 5 stars but with a seam error, I felt it deserved 4 instead.  That didn't stop me though from ordering it again in red & honestly I love both.  The colors are very pretty & somewhat muted, and the chiffon detail at the bottom adds the perfect touch.  The material is stretchy & it fits true to size.  I would suggest this top to anyone!",positive,positive

Great service, great product.  I'm a happy camper.",positive,positive

"I’d say these sports bras from BraNurY run small. I’m a 34A, so if I followed their size chart, I would wear a size small. But I had a feeling the bras would run small, so I went with my usual size: medium. And that was the right decision, because even the medium bras are a bit tight.<br /><br />I laid one on top of a comparable style Nike sports bra and it was smaller. The band *and* bust were smaller by about an inch.<br /><br />However, the sports bras are really comfortable to wear. They don’t feel super tight or constrictive, so go with your normal size. They offer light support, so I wear them for lounging or light activities, and I forget I’m wearing one. I like the wide band, it’s 3 inches wide and soft. Sometimes wide bands sit at the wrong spot on my ribcage, but these are very comfortable.<br /><br />The description says hand wash only, but I machine wash the sports bras on the gentle cycle, then line dry. They wash well, with no signs of fading or pilling.",positive,positive

"The latch mechanism in the buckle broke after I owned it for about 9 months. I'm lowering my rating from 5 stars to 1. Only 6 month warranty on this, and based off other reviews mentioning the same problem, I would NOT buy this belt again. The seller has not made any effort to stand behind their products or respond to any reviews either.<br /><br />I bought a SlideBelt to replace it. Much more expensive, but I'm confident it will last a while.<br /><br />Oh and for anyone who thinks they can buy just the buckle made by SlideBelts and use it with the strap from this one, it won't fit. This strap is just a little too wide. I ordered the buckle first to check, and then ended up ordering the leather strap from them too. I'm very happy with that one though, it is a much better design.",positive,positive

I looked on here to see if, by chance, I could find them not really expecting to but to my surprise I found them and for a much more reasonable price. I couldn’t believe it. Not only were they almost half the price but they’d be here before Christmas. My daughter was so excited when she opened them on Christmas because I had already told her I couldn’t get them. She was very surprised and she absolutely loves them. They fit well and she said they’re really comfortable.",positive,positive

I needed for a party and didn’t have time to return it or I would have. I also hemmed it because I’m 5’3” and it was sitting on my knees which is not a good look for my height. I bought the dark green and it was great. I bought a large and before I had to sew the underarms it had room in the chest I’m a DD, it was snug after the fix. Order in time for an exchange just in case. I really did like it though, super cuter and got lots of compliments at the Christmas party.",positive,positive
"I have fibromyalgia and other hyperactive autoimmune system issues.  Socks that are tight at all around my foot will literally make me break out in hives and bruise from the pressure.  These socks are great, because they are wide and comfy, with soft, thick material, but they are still long-ish and stay up on my feet.  Perfect for me.",positive,positive

"My sister bought these for my son as a birthday gift.  The strap was completely severed and someone stapled it back together.  Hard to know if the seller did this or if it was returned and not checked by the seller before reselling it to someone else - either way, it’s pretty disappointing. Otherwise they they seem to fit well and are comfortable.  We want to buy another pair ... that is actually new and undamaged.",positive,positive

"The brim on this hat is imperfect. The fabric is loose like cheaper brands. Obviously noticeable while wearing. I'm not sure if this is an imperfect being passed off as ""Brand New"" or maybe New Era is producing products with substandard manufacturing or poor quality control.

"This is GREAT !!!  I went on a cruise and went swimming in salt water.  As soon as I was out of the water my silver rings were BLACK !!  I thought I would have to replace them.  I first tried Connoisseurs Silver Jewelry Cleaner, https://smile.amazon.com/Connoisseurs-Silver-Jewelry-Cleaner-8OZ/dp/B0044B5WN6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1465593339&sr=8-3&keywords=connoisseurs+jewelry and it did nothing.  I then read the reviews of the Quan Polishing cloth and thought I would give it a try, before buying new rings.  In less than 10 minutes, my rings looked better than they had in a year.  I just rubbed the cloth on the rings.  The black 'dust' was on the cloth and my hands.  I then washed my hands, and washed the rings in soapy water with a tooth brush and shiny new.  I know the photos don't show it, but the rings were black and now are shiny.  You can really see the difference on the bracelet .",positive,positive

Exactly what I was expecting! Great shirt.,positive,positive
"Love these! I have a big head and face and they fit great! Complementing, stylish, very lightweight, authentic, and modern look to them. The sides are thin but not wire thin so as to add some unique style to an urban culture full of wire bending aviators. The have some flexibility in the frame when they are folded so if you sit on them by accident they will flatten and not break.Grab a pair! Don't hesitate! They are awesome!",positive,positive

"Cute pants! But a lil loose in the front area. 120pds 5'7 and I wear a US 0, ordered the small. I would someone who's a US size 3 these would fit perfectly on. The length is crazy long, I'm wearing 8inch heels in the pics to be able to walk without tripping, lol. Now if you can sew then all you have to do is cut the length that is appropriate and hemp the ends. I plan on doing that so I can wear them this summer with flip-flops... Gave these a 4 star because the color wasn't nearly as bright n vibrant as the picture shown. I wouldn't recommend these but that's only because I know of another company on Amazon who sells Bell's for cheaper n to me, way better quality plus they arent nearly as long.",positive,positive
The size was not accurate at all….way too small!,neutral,neutral
Definitely looked like gym shark material! Great stretch !,positive,positive
This skirt fits true to size. The fabric is soft and smooth and doesn’t crease easily. It is lined and the stitching is good quality. The skirt swings nicely as you move about. I’m 5’ 9” and it rests a couple of inches above the knee. This “school skirt” is very cute and makes me feel quite naughty.,positive,positive
"Putting these earrings in were one of the most frustrating 30 minutes of my life. They are SO DIFFICULT to close even when done backward.

"These are very good quality cuff links. When I first ordered them for my boyfriend, he was quite skeptical. He is 1 of those people that believe you get what you pay for. These are not the cheap flimsy cuff links that you can find on sale either at a store or online. Each 1 of them is quite sturdy and has a nice weight to it. They appear to be made out of stainless steel and hematite. They are black with a very nice shine to all sides. They are a square on the outside of the shirt, where you would see them. Each square is approximately 3/8ths of an inch across.Since they are black in color, they will be able to go with almost everything. We are both quite impressed with these cuff links. I did receive this item at a reduced price, in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",positive,positive

It is very bright and happy.",positive,positive

I am able to fit the essentials that I need, and it makes going through security a little easier. It’s not meant to replace a purse as far as holding a lot, but it was fine for what I needed inside the venue. The mesh zip lock bag is a bonus for securing keys or a phone, too.

"I like the irregular hem on this tunic/dress.  I put that in my headline because before I bought this product, I read reviews were people complained about it.  That is one of my favorite parts about this item.  READ the description and pay attention to what it says and you will be fine-- keep in mind to look at all that when determining your size.  I am overweight and 5 ft. 6 inches and I like my XL one.  I also love how the buttons go diagonal.  Very stylish!  The material is very smooth and I tried air drying, but it was more even in my dryer.  I know some people don't want to wash and dry it in machines, but for me, I'd rather order it big enough to be able to use the dryer and sometimes I use the hand wash cycle on the washer.

"This is more a shipping problem than a manufacturer/quality problem. The hat fit perfectly, although was a little chintzier than I expected and a lot darker but still not bad. I'd have worn it through the winter, since I'm sick of the sight of ball caps. No, what angered me was the fact that though the hat was packed in a box easily large enough to get from the West Coast to Massachusetts without any damage, THE PACKER HAD DELIBERATELY MASHED THE TOP DOWN. There is no other explanation and the hat is wrinkled in several places.. Utterly unacceptable and this thing is going back. Check out the Van Heusen trilby. Better made and keeps its shape after rough handling.",negative,positive

"Beware of loose threads. I bought 20 of these t-shirts in various colors. They look and feel great. They are a little bit delicate because I noticed if you fold them inside out most of the shirts I got had loose threads in the underarm area and the bottom of the shirt on the sides. I guess their sewing machine isn't properly tying off the stitch. I found a little trick, but only if you are confident not to burn your shirt....take a lighter and burn the end of the loose thread until right before it gets too close to the shirt, I use my breath to blow it out right away and after that it will seal the stitch just like a good knot would. I don't recommend this unless you have done this before with loose threads. But other that the loose thread problem the shirt looks very nice and tapers around me nicely.",positive,negative

"I suppose I got what I paid for . . . It came folded in a rectangle box.  Doesn't look like the creases would smoothen out, but, then again, they might if I put enough weight on or in it.  But then it might tear, because the &#34;material&#34; with which it is made is so flimsy, I'm not sure it could even handle my wallet, and it definitely wouldn't do so standing up.  This burlap sack with handles is NEVER going to stand up like in the pic.  The inside?  I can't say. I didn't want to hurt my eyes.<br />Here's the kicker: The return (by dropping myself at UPS store) is $15!!!! Almost as much as the bag.<br />I think I have a new cat toy.  Sigh.",positive,negative

I just want to say it has been since April 3rd and I still don't have this. I have no idea what it looks like yet  but it is taking so long I may never order from this again. If it comes in and is super cute and isn't cheap looking...maybe. I will be back to post another review when I get it.,positive,positive
Love this handbag except the fact that the strap broke  3 months after i purchased it. I am so disappointed because it took me a very long time to finally find a crossbody bag in the perfect size.,positive,negative

"The pants are to long to match the top, and the sleeves are to long to match the rest of the body. The material does not really give so your baby will eventually get stuck in this lol. Last but not least the snap buttons were plastic and a pain in my ass.",negative,negative
yep,positive,neutral
I love it! I bought the skirt in the dark teal and it is beautiful. The color is rich and just what I wanted. The material feels really nice and high quality. The pockets are perfect too.,positive,positive
"The green color is amazing and my favorite.  The dress can be worn dressed up with heels or down with sneakers.  I ordered a Medium and it was too large so I had to order a size smaller.  I would definitely say they run large.  I am 5'7&#34; 155#  stats:36,29,39",positive,positive
What a great piece. Took the advice of other reviewers and ordered up a size. Denim color is perfect casual light material. Love the flattering shape. Just ordered the black as well.,positive,positive
Not supportive at all<br />Doesn't fit as expected<br />Long straps with only a little foverage iver the breast,negative,negative
Highly recommended! I am a healthcare worker - no fog and super comfy!,positive,positive
I’m so disappointed with this purchase. I bought extra large but the item I receive was more like a small/med. it had a very bad odor. This is more for a short petite girl. Even then I would suggest getting XL.,negative,negative
"These are fantastic absolutely loved them. Girls love their pockets. They fit wonderfully felt amazing thin material (not see through) but still kept warm in colder weather.<br /><br />Bad part: rip easily, worthless stitching job. After washing them the first time the stitching on the pockets started coming out. I was starting to find holes in my pockets and one day my phone fell out of the back pocket and broke. Went to find out the whole damn bottom of the pocket completely detached and was a fake pocket flab hanging there.  Definitely recommend restitching them if you purchase!",positive,positive
Why the heck is this necklace so expensive lol it’s def $5 on any paparazzi website,positive,neutral

"I work from home, so I never have to put on real pants. These are perfect to break the black leggings monotony. Love all 90 Deg by Reflex bottoms!",positive,positive
The dress was perfect for a Hollywood glamor night of the '20s.  It fit well except it had to be shorten about 4'' for a 5' 5'' person.,positive,positive
Does not hold its shape very well but it is very comfortable and the color is great,positive,positive
"This bag is easily my favorite! It is beautiful, durable and just the right size for every day use. I love the drag gray color and all the pockets for organization. The company was incredible to work with when the lining of my original bag tore too. I will buy from them again.",positive,positive
The bees 🐝 are amazing and perfect size for my project.,positive,positive

"My first impression was not good, since Draper sent me the wrong backboard, but they promptly sent the correct backboard and picked up the wrong one; no diffculties doing this switch. The backboard is excellant; very good qualiy and finishing. It's heavy enough that the ball bounces back very well. It looks good on my 30 year old cemented in the ground pole for which I made brackets to support this backbboard. I bought the Draper heavy duty goal and now have an excellant backboard and goal which will last many more years. I am completely satisfied.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that the backboard description by Draper is very generic, so be careful that you select the correct part number for the backboard you want. I triple checked the part number before I ordered, and as I had mentioned Draper sent me the wrong backboard! Because of this mistake, I only gave a four star review instead of five.",negative,negative
"After only a couple of uses, these are good glasses.",positive,positive
"I ordered a size up as most suggested, the top is barely adjustable... As in when adjustments are fully slid down it fizes maybe a half inch... And even when hair tied snug the black material loks nothing like photo's. Will be returning...",neutral,negative
Order a size larger than you need!!!! Cute pullover just disappointed it runs small.,negative,negative
It's super cute but the earrings didn't come with a back... To lock the earring in place...,positive,positive
"Most small backpacks taper to a small top. It may be tall enough for an tablet, but the top curves in too much. This square shaped backpack works beautifully. My iPad slides right in and the backpack zips up neatly. The perfect shape.",positive,positive

Great solid tie bar for a slim to skinny tie. Tough to maneuver at first but omce you get it on its a great fit and hold a tie in place.,positive,positive
"Super cute, good quality. Evidently not completely accurate on character... my son says the little watch thing should go with Hermione costume, not Harry Potter. Also, would give 5 stars if came with more than one lightning tattoo.... most costumes are not just worn once and that can't be too costly to add a few extra.",positive,positive
Love it! 👍,positive,positive
SOOO cute! Love this top!,positive,positive
"They are a little bigger than I expected, but my daughter will grow into them in no time. These shoes are so cute and comfy. My daughter loves them.",positive,positive
"I bought a pair of these pants earlier this year and was very satisfied. This pair, however was poor/defector. Both the drawstring and the seam of the leg broke the first time I used them. I will return them.",positive,negative
Looks so beautiful on. Very nice fit. Love it very much,positive,positive
I love it it fits perfectly,positive,positive
Cheaper materials but it will serve its purpose I wish the main shoulder strap was like the backpack straps thick and padded. I purchased 2 one blue one black. The blue was a nicer color but I wouldn’t have purchased if I saw in person first. Will see how it holds up.,positive,positive
So cute!  A little heavy but love them,positive,positive
"The Mickey Mouse logo was off centered. Other than that, good fit. Its a Fruit of the Loom shirt so if you're wondering about the fit, try a size on at walmart so you can be sure.",positive,positive

I gave this hoodie to my 20 year old son and he wears it all the time. I didn't feel it was suited for me. I thought it might look cute and flowy but it was kind of stiff and uncomfortable.,negative,positive
"These have a nice dimension to them (they are not completely flat) and stick long enough to satisfy my 4 and 6 year old (sometimes a full day, most times don't make it overnight successfully).  Pretty on and a good size, not super tiny like some cheaper versions.",positive,positive

Beautiful jacket one big problem the lace sleeves while beautiful snag on everything especially the zipper. Even zipped up they catch on everything. Wore it the other day and have six pulls in the sleeves already would not reccomend. Shame because i really like it.,positive,positive
It was a little big in the waist,neutral,neutral
"This was cute, the length was great. I had gotten it ro maybe wear in engagement pics, but I thought ultimately it was too matronly and kind of large at the waist. Obviously, this is an A line dress. I got a Large and i am 5'5&#34; and weigh about 189-193 with 34dd. I would've kept it if the waist was able to be cinched a little more and if the skirt were a little bit more fitted.  Maybe a medium wouldve worked better for me.",positive,positive

Very cute little bag for a little girl between the ages of 3 and 5. My neice is a little older and it wouldn't hold all of the things she insisted on carrying in her new purse and eventually ripped. Her fault not the manufacturer.,positive,positive

I love these sunglasses. Fit well-don't slide down your nose. Plus they look great on.,positive,positive
The sizing is way off. We ordered a 2x and it fit me and I wear a medium in women’s.,positive,positive
"I have seen these boots in boutiques for $40+, so when I found them here for half the price, I had to snatch them up! I'm 5'10&#34; and I'm always looking for a low heeled boot- these are perfect. Not too high, but high enough to count. They aren't shiny like I thought they'd be, and they do seem to run a little large; however, if I would have gone down a size they'd be too snug. They are so cute and perfect for summer!! I almost wish I would have sprung for the blush colored ones! These are more versatile and will go with more outfits, though! Buy these boots. For real.",positive,positive
The design is beautiful and flowery. The material is pretty soft but it is pretty light weight. It will keep you warm but it is not for heavy duty use.,positive,positive
"Really pretty suit. I'm 5&#34; 115 lb. and I ordered a small. ordering up would have been too big. If you are asian petite, don't order up. I was hoping the back was a little Lower like the picture so I gave it a 4 star.",positive,positive
Belt seems good quality will have to wait until it gets worn a few more times. Daughter is a size 12 the XL fits perfect.,positive,positive
"The end that snapped on to the Fitbit piece did not connect well and frequently disconnected causing the Fitbit to fall off my wrist. In the end, it fell off while I was doing yardwork and I didn't notice. I found it later in the day, but only after a rainstorm and my Fitbit was ruined.<br />The positive things I will say is that the finish was very pretty and the magnetic closure was strong and stayed where I put it.",positive,negative
"The picture in the ad looked good, but it is the cheapest watch to buy or wear. It is made of questionable materals, and you can't read the dial easily. All the functions are hard to set and read after setting.  I liked the Roman numerals but that's all II liked about the watch. By the way, it only had one strap<br /> loop to hold the band tightly in place. It needs two! Amber G.",positive,positive
"When you open them they are in a nice white leather case that I think I will keep for my nicer sunglasses.  I was amazed at how flat they are and surprised there is not curve to these glasses at all.  They do not wrap around your head, they are all square corners.  That being said for this price point they are functional and I could use them as sunglasses.  I have purchased sunglasses at the same price point that have felt sturdier and I believe will last longer but at this price point I feel like it is a lot more of a gamble what you are going to get.  If you want cheap aviator style sunglasses that are very flat these work, just don't expect them to last well.",positive,positive
Great,positive,positive
"The hats smelled like gasoline (or some other industrial chemical) when they arrived. This made nervous knowing they were &#34;imported&#34;. I tried airing them out for a few days, but that did not help, so I just washed them a few times on gentle cycle, and let them air dry. That made the smell go away. They fit pretty well. Not super warm, so if it is windy, these may not work very well. Quality is ok. For the cheap price, they are about what I expected.",positive,positive
"Love this dress. Ordered in 3 colors. It's professional but casual. I did order a size larger based on the other reviews, and I'm glad I did. My usual size probably would have fit but it would have been uncomfortably tight and not flattering.",positive,positive

"I am in love with this dress.  Some people said the arm openings were too small but mine are perfect!!!!  I am 5'7 and wanted it to practically go to the floor so I ordered a Lg/Tall and it fits perfect...I am of the opinion  that you need to wear a belt with it because it is rather big.  True to color, true to size I'm thinking about ordering another one in another color.",positive,positive

Looking for a better material,positive,positive
I didn't give it 5 stars ONLY because the sleeves are short. They stop a good 2 inches from my wrist so it has to be worn with the sleeves scrunched up like 3 quarter style... which is fine but I would've liked that as an option not overall.<br />Super cute otherwise and fits good everywhere else!,positive,positive
"Beautiful embroidery! Not over the top. No loose threads. Material is thin like regular jeans you'd find in the mall but probably better.<br /><br />The pants fit me well. I could possibly size down, but they fit loosely in a comfortable way, right at belly button. When I sit, the back is low--don't wear high rise underwear. I'm size 10/12 typically in US and ordered a 2XL. It arrived a week earlier than estimated shipping--about 2 weeks. Zipper stays up.<br /><br />I LOVE that I can put most of my hands in the front pockets, where most designs have fake or fingertip short pockets.",positive,positive
"This color/fabric seems a little more loose than others and is the only reason for 4 stars. This is my fourth pair of these pants, I have both pant and Capri versions in many colors. I order xs and am 26&#34; waist, 36&#34; hips (for reference) I have worn them many times and put them through circuit training, running, yoga, barre and lounging and they have held up to them all and many washes. I recommend these to all my friends! The jade green ones feel much more &#34;stretchy&#34; than other colors, but I tend to like my pants to be very fitted.",positive,positive

"Inexpensive Rose Quartz/Amethyst type jewelry is quite common but much of it looks that way, common, with large beads that look more like marbles.  This bracelet says ""fine jewelry"" in every respect. The beads are all perfect, delicate, uniform and appear to be top quality. The silver chain is also appears to be high quality. The resulting piece looks great as casual or fancy-night-out jewelry. The price seems very reasonable for what you get.",positive,positive

I got the gold and blue stainless. Matches my shirt.  I removed two links.  Tight to get on but fits nice.  Slightly loose, some play.  I am sure in a month I will feel naked without it.  Got it for 50% off.<br />GET ONE.  Why I got a watch at 51, despite having a phone...  to monitor my life and slay project tasks.  Booting the phone up to see the time stinks.
