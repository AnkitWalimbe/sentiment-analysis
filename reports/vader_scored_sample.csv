"I am 5'7"".. usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.. 38 E/F  I ordered the xxl.  The top and body are loosely fit.  The bottom with the tie is oddly shaped.  You have to tie the tie very tightly because other wise there is a big loop that shows 'open' if you try to loosely tie.  The real issue is that the should cut outs are so poorly placed the holes are to the BACK of your arm!  I tried to reposition several different times and the openings will just not stay forward.  So weird looking, not ideal.  The color is a very pleasant true coral (pink/orange).  The material is very soft, but wrinkly.  Honestly, in my opinion this blouse is poorly made and the material is poor.  I would pass.  I would donate this, but in all honesty, its just too poorly made even for that.

"I just had to replace my old Fitbit 3 to the charge 4.  Good news - all the bands you bought for your charge 3 WILL fit your Charge 4.  Thank goodness.  I am always looking for a super easy on/off, breathable band.  This set is great.  I chose the white/gray and black.  They have a hook/loop like (""velcro"") that you easily press and pull to release.  the material is slightly stretchy, making it more comfortable.  So far, this one of my favorite types of bands.  Which they had better print options, but it is a bit of woven band - which may limit the choices there.  I'd rather have the comfort than that prints anyway.  You can adjust the band to fit your wrist exactly as you like it.  I like mine slightly loose.

The one thing I am disappointed about is there is a large, reflective leaf on the back neck of the shirt.  Yuck.  If I would have known that, I would not have purchased.

"I am 5'8""... 38DDD and usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  I ordered the XXL.  On the hole it fits pretty well... if not a bit loose.  The underarm area is fine (meaning the arm holes are not too large) and I pulled it on easily without unzipping the side zipper.  On the side zipper - it is a 'hidden' zipper with a metal head - so you can feel it under your arm.  This is very important: the material content!  96% cotton and 4% spandex - most of the spandex is in the top tank portion of the dress. This is important for cleaning and considering sizing.  Cotton will shrink some.  Sizing up is probably a good idea with this in consideration. The dress is surprisingly light weight - super light really.  I was expecting it to be heavier. The directions instruct: Gentle wash, DO NOT bleach DO NOT tumble dry and cool iron.  Meh.  Iron??  NOT my favorite thing to do and so if you are planning to travel with it.. plan on pressing it. Of course, a crisp, pressed cotton can look nice - but is a pain. On my hour glass plus body the dress hits me just barely below the knee, before washing, which is my personal fav.  I did attach a pick showing the capris I plan to wear with it because I hate my knees so much.  (Remember - the capris are mine and do not come with the dress).  The picture doesn't do me or the dress justice - the dress draped nicely no lumps or rolls as it was loose enough on me - the pooch seen is a pocket popping out - other areas that 'look' like rolls are just print and how I am standing. Honestly, no rolls from my body.  I am hoping once the dress is properly pressed - the pocket edges will stay where they are supposed to.  The skirt is slightly see through as well.  I am wondering if a fun little slip that poofs out a bit might be fun with this.  But a regular slip might be good if you're not doing capris like me.  I LOVE navy and white and this print is bright, clear and crisp - to me it screams spring/summer - just with the navy and white print.  The top tank is navy, and v necked.  The v does show cleavage on me - but not in an obscene way - in my opinion - sorry my cell hand is blocking that area.  I purchased a navy shrug to wear with it - for warmth - living in Oregon - even in the summer, at night, it can be cool - the navy shrug is not a perfect match in color but very close and I think it is complimentary.  Finally at the price of this dress, considering how few times I will probably wear it, it's a worthy purchase - not quite 5 stars for me (no ironing would have made that more appealing) but definitely a dress that will work for may different events - my nieces summer wedding... a tea... luncheon meeting.. I probably will not take it with me for travel as I never desire or have time to press things or send them out - just my personal choice!

"I am 5'8"" ... 38DDD and usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  The sizing is very small... I purchased a 3x and it's none to big! I would definitely size up significantly if you have a chest.  But it is comfortable. Not tight across the back even when buttoned and the sleeves are fashionably fitted and not overly snug. I don't plan to button the top button closed - good thing - it puckers as most things I get with buttons.  But the three quarter sleeves are perfect length.  I can easily button the lower 2 buttons... or leave them all open, which is my plan.  The navy is a nice, dark, rich navy - the white is bright and white.  The tag lists 3x... 80% acrylic, 18% nylon and 2% spandex.  Hand wash cold, do not bleach, do not twist and lay flat to dry.  I am have a handwash cycle and will use it.  And then a nice dryer shelf for laying flat to dry - no air.  The other thing I would like to note is that the nice bright white sweater has a tasteful white tag and the navy has a nice dark tag.  To me, that is a lovely sign of quality and taste.  Who wants a dark sweater with a white tag or a white sweater with a black tag?  The knit is fine, and well sewn.  In my opinion, worth the price.

"I am 5'8""... 38DDD... usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  I purchased the black floral print.  First, the obvious... the sizing is WAY off.  Super too small.  If you have a chest at all - pass.  The elastic waist fits like an empire waist... the pockets are way too high (because it's too small) and oddly, the print material has a slight sheen to it... unlike the other photos I saw of the non-print.  It's heavy feeling and in weight.  The tag notes 95% Rayon 5% Spandex.  - feels like it.  There is some stretch - but the sleeves were uncomfortably snug - and way too snug across the chest.  The tag notes machine wash - but no dryer - hand dry and light iron if necessary.  Made in China.  Honestly, if you're a women of curves - as I am, I would NOT recommend this even in the 2x - it's just too small.  It's disappointing that the sizing is so off.  But having said that - I am not really a fan of the way the material feels and looks.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, however, I am donating this dress - so there's not much more to say.  Hope this info helps you.",1,0.073,0.794,0.133,0.9029,positive

I can no longer wear pierced earrings so I am collecting a few pieces that I can integrate with other pieces I have.. I don't have a lot of &#34;turquoise&#34; options for earrings, so I will keep them.. but I can't really recommend them at this price or even less.  They'll work.. but they will not be my go-to's or my favorites by a long run. They do have a stone like feel...and are definitely turquoise like... the bracelet has a little weight. The earrings are quite light, good for comfort.  The fall is very small... they provide a very good photo of this on a model on the ad page.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I hope my effort and photo to provide this review is helpful to you!",3,0.035,0.78,0.185,0.9879,positive
"These earrings are actually very cute... I am into flower shapes.  I have included some pics I hope will help.  I also included a pic of the box I received as one review I see had a different experience that I did.  The box is quite lovely and quite useful as a gift if you chose.  They also included a cleaning cloth too.  The metal on the back and tiny edges is a rose gold colored metal.  They do have those lovely rubber comfort stoppers.  Why not rate them 5 star?  Well... each flower has a clear rhinestone or cz center... looks comparable to about a 1/4 ct diamond.  One of the earrings' center is .. well.. off center... not super noticeable at a distance... but sitting next to each other obvious. On the up side, they are very comfortable.  Stay on.  They are not super heavy.  The white part looks like enamel or enamel like- it is a creamy white... not a bright white.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

I can no longer wear my pierced earrings so I am collecting a few nice clip ons I can wear for a few hours... these are just lovely.  I am a lover of all kinds of shells and mother of pearl.  These are listed as abalone and they look so.  There are some black faux pearls in the center - one in the very center and seed like pearls around the center pearl...and they compliment the shell petals nicely.  Just one note... they are heavy.. They do stay on... but they are heavy.  They are fairly large. The clips are a silver metal of some sort. There is a little hole that you could add one of those rubber comfort stoppers and I may do that. Those also help the earring stay on as well as comfort. I have included some photos for your review.

"I can no longer wear my pierced earrings... so I am collecting a handful of small earrings to wear for a few hours here and there... wearing clip on earrings does take a little getting used to.. but these are pretty comfortable even still.  They come with rubber stopper comfort pieces.  The are sturdy... and stay on.. but so far, don't hurt.  The flowers are a very light cream color... with a gold like metal trim and back.

"The sizing is WAY off... I am truly a 38... but after reading other reviews I did size up to a 40.  Holy cow.  Good thing.  It will work for the few times I need a strapless bra.  Just go up at LEAST on size around.  I usually wear a 38DDD. The 40 is VERY tight even on the loosest hook.  I decided to try the &#34;E&#34; as a possible &#34;sister&#34; size and the cup is good... there is a silicone strip on the top edge of the cups.  Straps are included if you would like to use them in various configurations. The &#34;nude&#34; is very, very light in color.  The cup is very lightly padded - just enough for modesty - does not add to girth. I am hoping it will loosen some with wear - but I will rarely use it.

"Oh man.. these dresses are the cat's meow.  I bought 2 and came back to order 2 more.  I am 5'7&#34;... 38DDD, usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  The XX fits me perfectly. I am a little busty so it's sort of empirish.. but doesn't look maternity.  And the best part?? POCKETS ladies!! Oh yes.  Lovely pockets that don't stick out. Just handy.  I wear them over my swimsuits... I dress them up with jewelry... and/or a jacket.  The prints are vibrant and clear.  The wash beautifully (I wash on delicate and tumble dry on &#34;low&#34;).  If you try one, you'll come back for more I bet.  This dress would fit a wide range of body types in my opinion. Further, as I travel a fair amount, they pack so nicely, without wrinkles!  Love love love. And I rarely get to say that about clothes of any kind.<br />UPDATE:  10/3 ...  I've gone back to order 2 other prints.  They wash beautifully.  Wear so comfortably.

I included a couple of pics so you can see for yourself. The readers I am showing on top of one of the bags are what I would consider &#34;medium&#34; size... not terribly small or really large...  They are not super thick, but I think for the price, they are reasonable.  As you can see, they have a drawstring closure which is functional.  You can use the bag as I lens wiper too.

So... get what you pay for.  I plan to use it to hold my cell and maybe a few bucks, a credit card and a room key when I don't  have pockets on a cruise I am taking later this year.  I think it will work for that.  There is a zipper on the outside, back there is a zipper underneath the flap.  Inside, the is a small side compartment with a zipper as well.  It holds my Samsung Galaxy 5, a few bucks a credit card and room key, but if you want a lip gloss, it should be flat or very small.  I will update if there are wear or other issues.

"So.... why 5 stars... Because I purchased this for my best friend and just guessed the size... she is usually about an 18/20, 5'5"", about 40B/C. I always order one size up with suits - but here's the thing... she reported she LOVED the suit for color and style, but it was about 2 sizes too big!  In any case, she returned it and I ordered the 18/20.  I will review it once she's received it, tried it and found it to be the right size.  I had read others reviews that suggested it ran a bit on the small side... as my dear friend is not a ""small"" person, I added sizing which apparently was not necessary... I am thinking it may be that she is smaller in the bust area.. but we will see what she says.  Other than the sizing, she really loved the suit for color, pattern and style. Had it fit she says it would have been her new favorite.  So that sounds like it's worth it to get the right size.<br />UPDATE: Best friend reports 20 is the perfect fit for her.  She notes that if you are really big busted, you might need the next size. Hope this helps!",5,0.0,0.733,0.267,0.9969,positive

"I'm 5'10&#34; and a size 16 (XL in tops typically, 16 jeans) 38C chest, and this fit me in a size XL. It came right down to the bottom of my knees. Overall this is an ok dress. I wouldn't spend more than about $20 tops on it though. I tried it on when I first got it and then washed it on cold in a mesh bag and hung it to dry to make sure it wouldn't shrink and then tried it on again and it was fine. There are a bunch of loose threads on it, I feel like the buttonholes could really use another round of stitching to make them feel sturdier but they're fine. The fabric hangs well and has some nice drape to it and it came out with just a few wrinkles when air drying. I would just need to toss it in the dryer for a few minutes to fix that.<br /><br />I will say that if you have a larger than average chest, this probably won't fit you. The buttons on mine are strained, just toeing the line between being tight and starting to gap. I can get away with it but can easily see how the top would be an issue for anyone larger, and my chest isn't even that large for my frame at all, I feel like I'm on the smaller side actually.

A bit on the thin side and it almost fit more like a mock neck. The neckline wasn't as scooped as the picture shows on me.

"I was very disappointed with this night gown. First of all, it is primarily polyester and it feels like polyester. Since it is a blend, I was hoping it would feel soft, but it really doesn't. It's not scratchy, but it's definitely not soft. It reminds me of 1970's polyester pants. Secondly, it has an odd and unflattering fit. I wear a size 16/18 in women's. I ordered this in the 2XL. The straps are adjustable which helped, but the bodice has stitching that goes under the breast. Well, I'm a DD cup and I didn't fit in them at all! I knew it wouldn't be supportive because it's a night gown, but the stitching lined up with the upper third of my breasts and it looked funny because the majority of my breasts were below that line.

I am liking this style of face mask a lot. It has the advantages that come with tie masks without having to tie them every time you wear it. I tend to have issues with the elastic on my ears. I find that I have to keep messing with the elastic and readjusting it. I've been at the checkout line and my mask will pop off of my ear!

My husband prefers the disposable ones. My son is pretty flexible and selects his based on comfort and fit. These are nice face masks.I got the 3 pack variety and it has a white one, a blue one and a black one.  The white and blue ones  are light weight, but double layered. They feel cooler than some other cotton ones we have.  The black one uses a heavier material.

These are definitely nicer than the ones that our kids had to wear over their marching band attire that they were given during inclement weather.

"This is a cute bracelet. I ordered it for my teen daughter who is a big nature lover. It's styled like the Pandora bracelets. It took me quite a while to figure out how to open this bracelet. There is a bead labeled Pandora that opens up. It keeps the open end in place. The directions were emailed separately and there are instructions with photos on the item description. If you are not careful when opening that bead up, the beads may fall off of the chain rope bracelet. It is a nice size, but it didn't fit my wrists. I am a plus sized mom and my wrist measures at 7.5 inches. This bracelet fits up to 6.5 inches. It does fit my daughter though. Most of the beads make sense and go along with the nature theme. However, one of the beads is a money bag with a dollar sign which is a little odd to have with a frog, apple, snake, and leaf.

Regarding the fit, it was very comfortable. It's a very flattering cut and style. My daughter absolutely loved the way it made her stomach and hips look.

She did say she would wear it during the summer depending on what she was doing. The colors are bright and vibrant. The fabric doesn't wrinkle so that's a plus.

It's not a big deal, but it did get annoying to have to slide the end back onto the frames. The little piece that goes on to the glasses of these looks identical to the ones I've used before, but for some reason I am having much better luck with these.Plus, there is a set of extra end pieces if needed.  After several consecutive days of using it, my glasses have not fallen off once. The chain is a nice stainless steel. I have a plain chain necklace that is very similar to this. The silver color coordinates with my attire easily. I am very impressed with the quality and durability.

I hate wearing the old lady style with skirts because they drip a lot after you get out of the tub and in the winter, that's really uncomfortable! I usually wear a size 18, so I ordered the 5XL. I used the size chart for the item and I took my measurements.  It fits and is wearable, but it's a little too long and gaps a little on the sides below the chest/torso area. I think a size down would have been better. Since I ordered this for use in our hot tub, not to be worn in public,  it will work well enough. There are cup liners/pads, but no support at all in the chest area. A smaller size might have offered a little more support just because it's a little tighter. There are two ties in the back - one around the neck and the other at the lower part of the bra area. The one around the neck was a little annoying because I had to tie it so tightly to support my chest.  The color is really bright. It's more of a neon pink. The construction of the suit is fine.

And if I do let her, I insist that her shirt is long enough to cover her rear. These are the first leggings that we have purchased that don't look inappropriate on her. They are thick enough that you cannot see through the fabric. She usually wears about a size 8 pants. They hug her body well without being too tight or too baggy. The fleece lining is super soft and adds a little extra warmth. She felt that she would not be able to wear them to Winter Guard rehearsals because she would be too warm. The leggings are well constructed. She is very happy  with these.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discount for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",5,0.0,0.858,0.142,0.9726,positive
"My husband wears a watch daily. So far, this one seems to be a nice, good quality time piece. It came beautifully packaged. The watch strap is extremely comfortable to wear. My husband usually prefers watches that don't require buckle fastening, but because this one is so comfortable, he has been wearing it a lot.  It has been keeping accurate time so far. My husband is not always the best at taking care of his watches, so this falls in our price range. It's nice looking enough for him to wear to work or social events. This one is a good value for the price and meets his expectations.<br /><br />*I did receive this for free for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

"I can't read anything without wearing my Readers these days. I make sure that I keep a pair everywhere I might need one. I have ordered many different ones and so far, these are definitely some of the better ones. I often wear a pair on the top of my head so I have them handy. These fit well on my head without slipping down. I've had several different ones that keep slipping off my head when I bend over or tilt my head, these do not. The arms are sturdy and give just enough. The frames feel heavy duty and attractive looking. I am very happy with these! These are definitely better than the ones I pick up at the dollar store.",5,0.0,0.789,0.211,0.9753,positive

I have long hair and throughout the day it would fall apart and feels heavy, pulling and irritating my scalp. I am sure all the girls with long hair know what I am talking about. This bouffant has enough space to fit all of my hair inside without a hair tie. Being able to avoid touching my hair in a 12-16hr shift is a big plus. However, I am rating it 3 stars... because the color faded dramatically after just 1 wash, 1 drying cycle.

The cap sleeves are perfect and sit on a place where you don't need to worry about your bra strap showing. The only thing that I would suggest if you purchase this dress is to definitely size and compare your sizes to the charts it provides so that you can get an accurate fitting. Also, it is very form fitting, especially in the bottom area so underwear lines WILL show, so I would recommend purchasing either a thong or very thin underwear. What I did was purchase a stomach shaper that was high wasted and the leg holes went farther down to where it wasn't tight on the dress so the lines didn't show, that way you can also have a little added support and control to any tummy rolls and flatten it all down for a perfect fit.

"This is a very attractive stainless steel bracelet in an electric blue. It is designed for men but it works well for women as long as the links are adjusted. It is adjustable in the sense that links can be removed with the link adjuster. That is not an easy task but there are online videos to assist, There are NO instructions provided instructions in the box. The magnets are on the underside of the bracelet in every link.<br /><br />The magnets are supposed to confer health benefits such as pain relief, arthritis relief, body balancing, improve blood pressure, etc. I do not subscribe to such hocus pocus and, after having worn bracelets like this previously and tried this one, I have experienced no health benefit. However, wearing a piece of jewelry that is attractive is certainly mood enhancing. The current price of $18.99 is excellent for this. The only reason I rated this 3 stars is because of the health benefit claims that I do not see; otherwise it is a 5-star bracelet at a good price. If some health benefits are achieved for a select few individuals, then I consider that a bonus. It is definitely a recommended buy as jewelry.<br /><br />NOTE: Anyone with a pacemaker should not wear magnetic bracelets.  ",3,0.077,0.684,0.239,0.9922,positive

They wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry.<br /><br />They offer 15 to 20 mmHg Compression and are made of 45% cotton, 40% nylon, and 15% spandex. The current price of $19.95 is expensive for a pair of socks but is competitively priced with typical compression socks.

"I almost rated this hat 2 stars and if I saw this in a store, I would not have purchased this.<br /><br />The hat itself is very nice and very attractive in the various shades of brown. It has a partially canvass-like and knit exterior with fake leather and fur. The interior head area is quilted and the ear area also has fake fur. This hat is both warm and comfortable.<br /><br />The fur sheds, which is a negative. However, the biggest negative is the buckle. No matter how I tried, I could not fasten the buckle with the hat on. Instead, I had to fasten it before I put it on. Lucky I am still able to work my head into this with the buckle already fastened.  I personally only like clasps on these type hats. Having to rig this up like a belt is awkward and almost impossible to do. Had I not be able to get this on my head with it already fastened, I would have rated this 2 stars. It is only 3 stars because I am still able to use this hat.<br /><br />If this had a clasp like bike helmets have, I would have rated this 4 stars. If the fake fur was non-shedding as well, it would have gotten 5 stars.",3,0.099,0.804,0.097,-0.3213,negative
"I do not care for this scarf. It is very thin and also itchy. The edging is sloppy looking and the angled cut at the end is very unattractive to me.

"This blouse is both too large and too small at the same time. Also the cut is unflattering for heavier women. I ordered the 1X size because it is made of stretchy material and sizing is always a guess when ordering online.<br /><br />I take a large to 1X depending on the cut. However, this is designed poorly for those who are shapely. First of all, the shoulder area is huge. It is actually falling off my shoulders. However, the stomach area and where it is gathered in front fits but it is a snug and form fitting fit that makes me look like I am pregnant. It is just horrible.<br /><br />The only thing I like on this blouse is the 3/4 flare sleeves. Other than this, this blouse is not for me and does not fit right nor have a flattering profile due to the form-fitting waist and absolutely huge falling-off-the-shoulders neckline.",2,0.042,0.849,0.109,0.9145,positive
"This is a super attractive top. It is flattering and form fitting and should be worn with a bra, camisole, or other type undergarment. The fabric is thin and moves with my body. I love the peek-a-boo sleeves. It is true to size and the large fits me perfectly. It also makes me look more slender than I am and I am big on top.  The tulip-cut bottom is also extremely complimentary and goes well with leggings. However, I do wish this was about two inches longer on the bottom. It drapes down to my upper thighs and I am 5 feet 5 inches tall.<br /><br />The smell of the fabric is the only thing that prevented me from rating this 5 stars. I am hoping it washes away over time.  It is made in China of 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex and is best washed in a lingerie bag in the washer and then hung dry. Tumble drying this tunic will destroy it.",4,0.031,0.749,0.22,0.9852,positive
"I am personally not crazy about this bag because it is so large. It fits my 12.9"" iPad with its cover with no problem and has room to spare for wallet, phone, keys, etc.<br /><br />The front is buff colored with two strips of dark brown and a buckle in the middle as decoration. The reverse side has a generous zippered pocket that will fit a small writing pad. The interior is a snap closure with one zippered pocket and two slip pockets on the opposite side.<br /><br />There is a regular carry handle and also a longer shoulder strap. What is interesting is that the shorter carry handle is gray to match the gray strip down the middle of the bag. However, the should strap is buff colored to match the rest of the bag.<br /><br />In addition to the above, the bag also comes with a ""Moda labeled"" clear plastic string-backpack-type ""bag"" shown in the last photo.<br /><br />In summary, this bag is not for me as I do not like its large size, shape, and style.  It is made of faux leather and looks and feels cheap to me in person. The cloth interior feels nice, though and the zippers glide easily. On the positive side, since it is made of PU leather, it is easily cleaned and maintained. It is spacious but I was not looking for something so large. It is functional and useful but, after having seen it, is not my style. However, if someone is looking for a large bag that gives the appearance of leather from a distance, then this might fit the bill.",3,0.025,0.889,0.086,0.9306,positive
"This is my first pair of bike shorts so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I was a little surprised at how much padding is in these shorts. It goes from the front to the back and does help soften the seat during a ride. Unfortunately, walking in these is like having something stuck between my legs. I personally hate that but I suppose it is expected with bike shorts. The large is also a little loose on me which is surprising.<br /><br />Overall, this will be my first and last pair of bike shorts simply because I cannot handle the feeling of having a wad of gel padding in the seat area.",3,0.085,0.871,0.044,-0.5736,negative
"This infinity scarf is made in China of 90% polyester and 10% linen. It is a very nice loop scarf and looks good on me. However, it is a bit itchy and it is too warm for the summer.  Otherwise, it is very attractive. I rated this 3 stars due to the itch and the fact that this is labeled a spring/summer scarf when I feel it is more fall/winter.<br /><br />This pairs exceptionally well with this [[ASIN:07PWVVL89 accsa Women's Fedora]].",3,0.025,0.816,0.159,0.8854,positive
"I LOVE HATS. They are an obsession with me. This is a very wide brim summer hat that is great for sun protection. I personally prefer smaller brimmed hats simply because wider brims flop. This rim is no different. It does rest down toward my shoulders; however, I like the protection if offers and it is moderately attractive on.<br /><br />The head circumference is small on this hat. I take a small hat so it fits me perfectly but someone else might have a problem. The bow is a nice touch. The head cap itself is also a bit floppy and the only thing that makes it hold its shape is the shape of ones head in the hat.<br /><br />If the brim were smaller, this would have gotten five stars from me. I am glad for the small head size, so the sizing is perfect for me. The black trim is also decorative and helps glam this up a bit.<br /><br />Attached are two photos of my stuffed giraffe modeling this latest acquisition.",4,0.046,0.804,0.15,0.9658,positive
"I love the variegated color and the soft feel of the faux fur against my ears. I wore them last night and they kept my ears warm in the cold.<br /><br />However, these ear muffs suffer from the same problem as most of my ear muffs . If my hood or coat collar hits into them, they will move around or pop off my head. The only muffs that stay put are the cheap ones whose ear ""buds"" fold in on themselves. Even my expensive UGG muffs have this issue, because like these, there is no flex built in for movement.<br /><br />The faux fur did shed a bit at the beginning but now that has stopped. I believe that is probably due to ""wayward hairs"" left over from the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Overall, I really love these. One other positive is that they do not give me a headache. Some other muffs squeeze my brain so tight, that I get head pain. I do feel the current price of $25.95 is about $6 too much for these, however. The only reason I took off one star is because of both the price and the fact that there is no movement in the ear piece or headband--but then again that is typical of most muffs.<br /><br />- Body is 94% polyester and 6% spandex.<br />- Faux Fur is 84% moda acrylic and 16% polyester<br />- Filling is 100% polyester<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 10, 2019 - I also ordered this in the [[ASIN:B07HKSBNCF gray]], which looks like a variegated brown. It is just as nice as the other ones, except the pair I received is a bit tighter around my head and the end of the muff comes right to the end of my ears. Since these are not adjustable, I would expect some people with big or tall heads to have a problem with these muffs not covering their ears.",4,0.057,0.872,0.071,0.765,positive

"I love newsboy caps or what I call dutch painter caps. This one is for winter. It is lined and keeps the top of my head warm.  I would have rated this 5 stars if there were not two disappointing issues.<br /><br />ISSUES<br /><br />- First, the rim is tight. I had to wear this hat about 30 minutes before it loosened up enough to feel comfortable. I always take a size small hat, so I think anyone who has a medium or large head would get a headache at least at the beginning until the band loosened. The tight band is necessary to keep the hat secured, but it did take some getting use to.<br /><br />- Second, the rim is folded over and it takes a lot of effort to have it folded the right way. After 30 minutes, the rim stayed put but then it folded over again during non-use.  The second photo shows the rim folded over the cap lid and the third photo shows it folded correctly. It has to be folded correctly to secure the cap to the head, otherwise there is no elastic to keep it in place.<br /><br />Since I take a size small cap and the rim will eventually stretch and stay put, I love this hat and cannot wait to wear it during the winter (with ear muffs, of course). It is super attractive.<br /><br />MATERIAL and CARE<br />- Shell is faux fur at 72% modacrylic and 28% polyester.<br />- Lining and filling are both 100% polyester.<br />- Dry clean only.",4,0.01,0.881,0.109,0.9757,positive

There is no tag on it but the Amazon site says it is made of 100% acrylic. As you can see from the photo, the edges are also kind of &#34;ratty.&#34; There is currently no price posted, but in its current condition, I would not pay more than $12 for this scarf.<br /><br />I usually wash scarves like this in a lingerie bag and hang dry them.",3,0.045,0.851,0.103,0.768,positive
"This cap feels sturdy. It is similar to a typical baseball cap with a mesh back (for ventilation). The front of the cap is made of a fake leather that can be wiped clean. I LOVE the wide brim because it keeps the sun out of my eyes. The back is easily adjustable with the typical plastic snaps typical to most caps of this style. The color is a baby pink that is perfect for summer.<br /><br />However, I have one absolute HATE. There is a black asterisk embroidered on the back next to the strap along with the words &#34;about last night&#34; above the strap. I am not usually one to wear suggestive messages such as this and for this reason only, it is a two-star hat to me. I wish I had noticed this before I placed my order.

"This is a nice leather case for small eyeglasses. My eyeglasses slide easily into the opening as you can see from the picture.  The interior is not lined, so the leather comes in contact with the lens. However, it is not scratchy so it has no ill effect.

"This is an attractive suit that I found just a bit tricky to get into. I like the easy closing clasp around the neck. The straps in the back can get a bit tangled when putting this on but straighten out once pulled up to the neckline. This suit does not have any type of control built in, so one's shape shows as is--fully tummy and all. What I do not like is the bra inserts. On the one I received, the right insert kept folding over and it was difficult to straighten out. Personally, I do not like inserts of any kind in a bathing suit or bra. However, if they stayed in place that would be acceptable, but these do not. It is mainly for this reason that an otherwise attractive suit is a disappointment to me.<br /><br />The label recommends hand washing only and line drying. I always machine wash items like this in a lingerie bag and hang dry.",2,0.05,0.765,0.185,0.9734,positive
"This card holder is very small and good enough to hold about 10 business cards comfortably and one ID in front of that or one business card in front.  This is stitched well and genuine leather. Mine arrived with two glue or some other stains on it that I was able to mostly wipe off. The front slot has a hole (not a pull tab) that allows one to push the contents up from the bottom.<br /><br />I do not recommend this as a wallet or to hold bills as it is way too small. I do feel the current price of $23.99 is $6 to $9 too much for this since its carrying capacity is limited.

I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.<br /><br />One caveat, however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased, they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.<br /><br />To me both socks feel the same.

"My boyfriend gave me a set of similar AND1 low cut socks in black. They are the performance type in size 6 - 12.5 and not the ultra soft type listed here. Nevertheless, I suspect they are similar in every other way but the softness and the color. Originally, he purchased them for himself because he is a size 12 foot. However, after wearing them and washing them, they shrunk tremendously as you can see from the photo. Since he considered them tight before washing and way too tight after washing, I inherited them.<br /><br />I tried these and they are soft but thin. Since I am a size 9, they fit me well after the shrinkage. Nevertheless, I personally do not like a product that is not true to size (as my boyfriend discovered) and I am totally disappointed in a brand that shrinks.

"This chain is a little too thin for my taste; however, I like that it is cylindrical (round and rope-like) instead of laying flat against the neck. Although I didn't take any points off for this, my chain arrived with a small kink in it that will not come out.  I didn't want to return it because it's not that noticeable when I put the chain on; however, this tells me that the chain is impossible to reshape when bent simply because it's not a link chain and acts more like a wire.<br /><br />Overall, I like the chain but would have preferred that it was a little thicker so I'm glad I didn't order two of these chains like I was going to.

Shirt doesn’t wash up as “ready to wear” as i’d hoped. Definitely needs some touch up for wrinkle free/collar tweaking prior to wearing..<br /><br />Overall, Best way to describe- I appreciate this shirt from afar but, it was far from my expectations.. At $22 I find it looks better then it’s made. A bright vacation or golf shirt maybe- but, not one to mix into daily wardrobe for us.

"This pair of mens shorts are meant for casual wear- Just be sure you realize that- nothing of a zipper/ button walking short!! With sack style cinch waistband, one can get a desired personal fit using the tie over the elastic waistband.. these resemble swimsuit trunks in style just made of different material!<br /><br />We found fit to be standard with US sizing but, bc of their simple style- they are not formfitting. These actually have a bit of a baggier bulk thru the front. These have slit pockets on hips to help make them functional.. along with back pockets for wallet.<br /><br />Material is soft and stitching seems solid. No loose threads and finished with a solid tucked edge. *Note: Knot tie strings on the waist.. otherwise, you may lose it into the abyss which is maddening! Washed on cold and dried on low heat- we had no issue with shrinking or fading. (If fit is ideal prior to wash- I’d recommend line dry to avoid unwanted shrinkage!)<br /><br />Ordered XL and for reference: husband is 6’3”, 210lb, 34x36 waistband- active but not overly athletic 50yr man build. In swim trunk or athletic short we usually order XL as well.<br /><br />Best recommended for those looking for casual dress down shorts to hangout or do outdoor activities- these are not athletic shorts nor, walking shorts.. they are a perfect “in between!” My husbands highlights with these: the ease and comfort in wearing.. no belt needed.

"I’m a sucker for the perfect white tee shirt- only this wasn’t it! I love the idea it’s recycled material.. but I’m thinking maybe that’s why it felt a bit off? Soft yet, stiff- which is not an easy thing to do!! Cut in “boyfriends style” one expects a looser fit.. only this was ‘big’ in most of the wrong places- sort of a mismatch of measurements. Shoulders don’t have any drop like most in this style and sleeves were cut short and standard style. But, body was as wide as a box- very unbecoming to any female curve.. makes one look wider throughout the middle and I don’t know a female who appreciates that! Tbh, it is the neckline that totally shut me down.. a cross between a V-neck, scoop and standard- a trifecta of off.. it looked as confusing as I felt.<br /><br />For $27- this was a higher price for a T-shirt that missed the mark. I realize body type plays a part and so does personal preference. I also appreciate recycled aspect.. hence the a star for each. Definitely some likes/dislikes to consider prior to ordering- hoping this info can help your decision.. stay safe everyone.<br /><br />**For reference: I’m 5’2”, 151lb, 38C, 31x30, 40+ yr. with my trouble spot thru middle/waist area (all thx to my x4 kids and gravity..!!) ordered an XL- to help with size comparison.",3,0.101,0.735,0.165,0.9566,positive
"For a price point under $20- this is a top that can actually do its job and provide ample coverage as a base layer.. But, the shirt is multifaceted and can also be used as a light pullover to lend a layer of protection from the sun..  if going casual- this even has the ability to stand alone on its own!<br /><br />Material feels nice and soft with a small stretchable quality.. although a synthetic, this has a breathable lightness to it. Seams are stitched straight and on point- no loose threads. Ordered in light gray it has a small dime size “logo” imprinted on the chest (ours is in the same color as the shirt..) almost unnoticeable except for it’s silver sheen. Both the length in sleeve and torso- are comparable to U.S. sizing chart. A nice solid fit thru the body which is helped in part by the elastin stretch the fabric provides- it eliminates the appearance of a square boxier cut + feel for those with slender builds.. and yet, this has room to fit and forgive a bit without looking seer-sucking! (I included photos of fabric of close, logo, seams + shirts cut.. in case it helps!?)<br /><br />For reference: My son is- 6’4”, 187lb, 33x36, active but, not super athletic build..18yr. caught between a man/boy body! This shirt nicely drapes his silhouette vs. hangs on his body type. *Note: neck opening is a tad wider at the shoulder points which is different then usual round opening (in womens style this is referenced as a “boat neck” Im not sure if it was just us who noticed this anomaly.. but, something to take notice of. Not a deal breaker just creates a slightly different finished look.<br /><br />For an unknown brand this has the quality and ability to do its job at a solid price.

"Uncertain how these mishaps happens.. With using measurements provided by seller along with the items visual aid- you’d think I should be on target with size.. Upon arrival top was smaller then expected and unfortunately the one I received has a twist in material at the neck.. problem is, its been sewn together this way- making the twist a permanent issue that can’t be fixed or laid flat.. As for sleeves- its as if bat wing has taken on a whole new meaning.. as these are not anything Close to the definition of the style! Sleeves almost seem to be attached too high up in the arm pit?? Photo shows a double length cuff at the wrist and this is shorter for sure.. definitely some of the features and details are missing on the top I received compared to photograph. Neck line is made with the reinforced collar as shown- but, it wears tighter around the neck so be aware.<br /><br />As for length- this hits below the cheek.. waistline is more gathered vs. relaxed like it is shown. I’d say it’s possible body type issue… but, not if I ordered according to this brands provided measurements?<br /><br />Overall, fit is smaller and unfortunate not to meet the needs I was expecting. Material is smooth but, NOT soft. It’s as if your running against the grain.. very deceiving bc, it looked so inviting. Unfortunately, I can’t recommend with so many discrepancies and if choosing to order… Be sure and size up and inspect that ut meets your needs.

Once beanie begins to lose shape (stretched/loose..) machine wash on cold/delicate cycle and air dry only! Doing so, will bring hat back to its original shape- without causing shrinkage.<br /><br />Worn all day.. this isn’t irritating or itchy to the head.. this doesn’t have an interior liner that can cause a lot of discomfort- making this a possible option for all four seasons- (yes!! Beanies are the new baseball cap- they’re worn year round!)<br /><br />The beanie itself has ample material along with a pre-set cuff..  Best of all this is not tact/sewn in place.. letting cuff be adjustable or if desired it can be unfolded and worn straight.<br /><br />Straight forward this is a solid beanie and a $10 price point- definitely one I could recommend.

"Welcome to comfort! This sweater reminds me of a warm and favorite blanket- Just without the look of wearing bed linens when you enjoy its creature comforts!! Such a cozy softness is in the buttery chenille.. It truly feels delicious! This shows quality in both its design and construction.<br /><br />This is a nice crop length- not short, it’s slightly tapered.. This top gives you a proper amount of coverage to fall into place at the waist without causing excess bulk thru the mid section.. Ha! who wouldn’t love that!? Sleeve length is ample- mine hit just below the wrist bone- note: sleeve edges are finished but they are not cuffed<br />Neckline is made with a ribbed collar edge to help keep its shape and eliminate it from becoming stretched out! (see photo of neck up close)<br /><br />Although this isn’t a thick pile or chunkier sweater.. it will bring plenty of heat! Definitely an option to use in winter wardrobe (one that can even be layered.) TBH, the only specific I didn’t care for is the cable knitring on the front side. I realize this is just a personal preference but, I prefer the sleeker line. Cable knit has a “rippling effect” and I don’t need help in that dept.! Especially down the front of the sweater.. not a dealbreaker- but, something to be aware of.<br /><br />Overall, The soft comfort is a welcomed addition to my fall and winter options!

"You will not find softer, more inviting, skin friendly fabric then right here..!! Hands down- AmaZinG! A thinner, stretchable material w/ moisture wicking liner. But, the cherry on top to making these different is the built in pouch in leui of an open fly! These have sort of a “makeshift pocket shelf pouch” mechanism made to hold “cargo!”… sorry, I’m trying to be appropriate!!? A place to keep things out of the way for optimum comfort and minimal adjusting.. at least I’ve been told!<br /><br />Are you struggling to keep things in place?? We found boxer pouches just after puberty for our now, 18yr. old son who forever fought how to comfortably fit everything into his uniform pants.. After a heart to heart with his mama.. (one brave boy! and how I knew he must really be in need of a fix!) sent me for a solution and pouch boxer briefs was it!! IF, experiencing the same struggles- I suggest give this style a try!!<br /><br />These are over the top in their presentation (see photos included!!) 100% giftable and gift ready upon arrival.. each pair individually arrives in a “matchbox style box-“ (set of 3 could even be split amongst recipients) These are definitely not a drugstore boxer pack! At this price point, you’re paying for quality built to hold up longer with more creature comforts.<br /><br />Washing: Hand washing is instructed. TBH, I use the hand wash cycle on my machine and then, air dry.. just as I do with most delicates held for a separate load. To each his own.. Just know pairs seem no worse for wear when washed this way- and I air dry to avoid shrinkage. Reason I deducted x1 star was for washing headache-<br /><br />For reference: My son is- 6’4”, 187lb, 33x36, active but, not super athletic build.. caught between a man/boy body!

"Ordered for my Sr. in high school as this was something in his wheelhouse of fashion.. Note: this is a very trendy item- baggier, drop crotch, below waist fit, oversized pockets. I liked the idea of having a casual style pant but, in a khaki color!<br /><br />These are a thicker weight- similar to a heavier sweatshirt… Only, once opened up- Im unsure why the clothing felt damp or worse.. sticky!!? Whhaa..? I’m still baffled as to why- I’m just guessing its pre-treated fabric.. maybe a Scotchgard??<br /><br />Washing: machine wash on cold and line dry.. these do run SHORT (Or, shorter!!) be careful with the shrinkage!!! However, after completely dry I had to use a few dryer sheets to run cycle trying to soften treatment on fabric.. guessing I’m 80% of the way there! Hopeful next wash does the trick.. just note: treatment used is stiff on the material.<br /><br />Sizing: bc of my sons height, we adequately size for length. For reference: 6’4”, 188lb, 33x36, 18yr- in between a man/boy body.. active but, not overly athletic build. Ordered XL- with these having a tie elastic waist they were easy to accommodate a nice fit. Cuffed at the ankle- these fall approx. 2” too short..!! Mine must wear his high top shoes to compensate for the discrepancy. Take note: if taller then 6ft. this may be an issue..<br /><br />Overall, I find the treated fabric and it’s nuances along with overall style + fit to be at a high price point at $40- from photograph on website, it’s a bit hard to see this is a trendier fit and different then what we were wanting.

"Light weight hoodie- perfect for summer evenings and fall transition.. Marled fabric makes top easy to match with various colors.. Olive green has a heathered gray threading that mixes colors subtly- pairs with khaki, monochromatics, camo, cream, white, etc. Love the length! perfect for those who are shorter! At 5’2” (152, 36C, 31x29, 40+yr old) it is hard to find adequate fit thru the chest and not look like a disheveled mess drowning in fabric mess! This has a small inline taper from armpit to waist- eliminating a boxy appearance.. Mechanics of zipper work well and allow easy on/off access. Nice size pocket for cell phone or keys..<br /><br />I categorize this for daily fashion vs. athletic attire. Nice to throw over a Tee or tank but, can stand alone on its own just fine. A price point of $25 is reasonable for the quality to last a season or two.. Fabric is soft without stitching flaws or loose threads.. being a synthetic, Machine wash on cold and line dry only to avoid any shrinkage.<br /><br />Take note: measurements provided online are NOT 100% accurate! Ordered XL = 49.6” per listing- yet, actual top measures 45.3” on top received. I suggest ordering what would be your regular size and error on sizing up. (Per size chart provided I would need a M/L but, I ordered XL like usual and glad I did.. otherwise, it wouldnt have fit!!) Be aware + adjust accordingly.

"Very soft and non irritating to wear for long periods of time. Has ample give- making it great for those with a bigger noggiń.. Not too much compression to cause that dreaded headache!! When shape stretches out.. wash in cold on delicate- line dry 95% of the way and the last 5% place in dryer on medium heat. A little extra effort to avoid a lot of shrinking!! This will regain shape and tighten threads back up with washing-<br /><br />Perk: beanie is made without any internal liner stitched in… this lets one roll the hat at the brim to take up extra slack on the top and create a personalized length and fit. Beanie is pliable and easy to roll- and material is continuous both, in/outside so it still looks the same with or without a roll!<br /><br />This is midweight in warmth making it great for those who prefer to wear a beanie all x4 seasons like my son does! (Mine likes to make a 1” flip just at the brim in the front.. and this beanie holds the position just fine!) Branding patch is nicely placed not to interfere with however you choose to wear hat. This is definitely unisex and can be enjoyed by any.<br /><br />Overall, a great choice for those who wear a beanie as a staple in their wardrobe year round.

"I was really anticipating this top and had a lot of expectations for its arrival. The top looks like the photo however, the material used feels almost childish- something children’s clothes would be made from!!?! For some reason I expected a more free-flowing fabric… This reminds me of a toddler’s romper/T-shirt??  Not necessarily a good look for a mom in her 40’s!<br /><br />The cut is boxier but, it’s staying in line with the latest trend and the snaps on front- I like the idea in theory. But, again- toddler romper vibe with the style.. ugh! I’m not certain how I expected these to be dressed up/down but, I do feel a bit silly wearing the top.. ordered in periwinkle/sky blue and this doesn’t help- I just look like a boy toddler in a romper- ha ha..

"OK! When I see the words “tummy control and butt lift“ I expect the item to help do some of the heavy lifting.. apparently, these pants did not get the memo! Albeit, they are high waisted and do reach ones naval- this is just an extension of the regular pant material.. no special reinforcement or, band to aid tummy troubles- and with the gift of having x4 babies and that wonderful thing called gravity.. not having extra support is a fatal flaw!! Never trying pants to help hold up the “caboose” I was excited but, these too don’t have any magical powers in the rear..<br /><br />Material used is soft and made with a stretchable thickness. Ordered in pink and it’s pretty nice hue- it matches photo description. All stitching and seams are on point, no loose threads.. pants have a reinforced crotch for extra security, movement, comfort. At a $25 price point these are solid and not see thru. These have X1 zip pocket but, my favorite feature are the 2 outside pockets which hold anything from ones chapstick to car keys or, cell phone.. The pockets also help transition these pants into carpool and errand running attire- again, total bonus!<br /><br />As for the fit: I found these run small… If between sizes, I suggest sizing up! They are a skinnier fit through hip and waist area- But note: the length is a bit shorter so, if you struggle to find yoga pants for shorter height- these meet that criteria! For reference: 5’2”, 140lb, 36C, natural waist 28.3- ordered in Medium.. A large would have offered for more comfort, wiggle room and been a bit more forgiving. If, one has zero room to spare in the fit.. I would recommend washing on cold and line drying! Doing so will avoid shrinkage yet, it still allows pants to regain their shape.<br /><br />Overall, these yoga pants have ability to perform well- Just be sure to realize the details prior to ordering..

Yesss- Glass does have the colored reflective mirror lens as shown, just like photographs. So, be sure this is a look you appreciate before ordering..<br /><br />Surprisingly these fit really snug and secure through the temple arms and hold well in place over the ear- I swear this type of fit is missing from 95% of all “off-the-shelf” sunglasses?!! After wearing for an afternoon- there doesn’t seem to be extra pressure at the nose bridge or, the pads- as these are so light weight. Truly, you can forget they are even on!! (with the exception you look super cool..!!)<br />These come with the protective sleeve and I would suggest using it to prolong the life of the lens. My husband is less than stellar at this… And put a small scuff into the lower corner. (note: glasses should not to be stored in a drink holder carelessly!) So, if not careful… These can scratch and scuff. However, being careful will help immensely!!<br /><br />The wooden aesthetics is totally on point- they look and feel every bit the part of a unique, hip pair of shades..

"Wowza!! This is a very stunning look for those who can pull it off... and my varsity college athlete can! Of course, I think it goes without saying - this suit would not be for everyone yet, when one has the physique they've worked hard for (or, naturally been blessed with!)  this is a stunning way to celebrate that.. I find this is NOT trashy or, too skimpy- but, tastefully done in a way to feel confident in accentuating the female assets and enjoy sitting poolside or, playing at the beach.<br /><br />The top is reminiscent of that like a sports bra in the fact, it offers a mid compression tightness to keep things in place! It is a pull over design but, features a sliding shoulder strap.. such a great way to give one the more personal amount of support and fit needed.. I love this feature!<br /><br />The colors are amazing!! The material used let’s the Aqua-teal just pop!! Color looks the same on monitor as it does in person. As for material... It feels just like a swimsuit should- however, this material is ribbed giving the overall suit, a sportier vibe. **I recommend hand washing and air dry- just to prolong life of the elastin in the material.<br /><br />As for the fit.. keep in mind- this rides high up on the hip bone.. and takes a deeper “dip” under the naval and ends by partially exposing the cheeks!! (this is in line with the current trends and style of the cheekie bottoms..) This is NOT a T-back or, G-string by any measure.. but, one should definitely take note: this does not provide overly ample coverage over the “bottom” back side.. no pun intended!!<br />The fact this is a straight solid in an easy to match color- makes this a great option for mix/match pairing with other swimsuits you may own..

"Note: there are 2 different styles available on this listing. I chose to order the longsleeve V-neck with front chest pocket tunic in a solid white..<br /><br />Item runs adequate to U.S. sizing and is made with a rayon mix.. this also has spandex to offer a bit of stretch. This has plenty of length through the sleeves and torso.. and falls lengthwise about top-mid thigh.. material is soft and stitching seems to be on point with no loose threads or, sloppy seams. White is not “see thru” but, it is shadowed!! (allows you to see the outlining/silhouette of under layer.. which is often expected with white T-shirt) So, I do suggest wearing with flesh colored bra- to keep this to a minimum.<br /><br />The cut is a little boxier thru the shoulders but, does sort and figure itself out as it hangs down nicely on the rest of the torso.. if, you don’t want any shrinkage- I would recommend washing on cold and line drying only. The V cut is classic and not overly revealing at all- it frames the perfect when worn at the collarbone!<br /><br />For reference: I’m 5’2”, 154lb, 38C, 40+ yr. old with trouble spot thru the middle (thx to my x4 kids and gravity..)

A warmer, thicker, heavier threaded material does nothing but, add to the quality and comfort.<br /><br />Love the color: The marled charcoal gray and black make these a really great blend of color that is easy to wear with various  dress slacks- black, olive, gray.. we’ve had a spot on match so far!<br /><br />For my husband who wears an 11.5 but, has a real skinny foot- these fit in a size large. There was minimal shrinkage and socks have held up nice so far.. no loose threads or pilling as of yet and socks have held their elasticity. Best part of all, they don’t add extra bulk so, dress shoes still fit comfortably... yay!!<br /><br />For a price point under $15 for five pairs- you truly can’t go wrong.. the only issue some may have, is the brand name printed on the top.. it’s a bit of a nuisance but, not a deal breaker since it’s covered by the pant leg.. but, something to be aware of!<br />I hope this info can help your decision.. feel free to let me know!",4,0.034,0.761,0.205,0.9922,positive

"This was a sweatshirt that appeared great from a far but, far from great- at least for me!! This type of top needs a class of its own- Because, ones definition is different when using the word “sweatshirt!“ This has a smooth, thin, sheen to the fabric that is present with some of the cheaper made items.. this doesn’t look bad when seen from a photo- but, as the person wearing it.. I didn’t care for it at all. most likely because, I was expecting something for a different in the traditional sense of the word sweatshirt!! I feel, it takes more than cuffed neck, sleeve, waist to be classified as such.. So, for this reason- I was a bit let down.<br /><br />My next issue would be the fact, this material does not breathe in any real capacity.. it has that synthetic blend which causes sweat and also, static electricity..!! (Tbh, it reminds me of nightgowns back when I was a little girl.. and not in a good way! Fun to wear- but, just as obnoxious!!)<br /><br />The final piece that didn’t feel right and I will own this for not investigating deep enough. Marbled is not dyed material!! It is imprinted onto the outside layer- this is the type when inside out.. it looks white!<br /><br />As for the fit and construction, this seems to be on point with US sizing and made to expected standards for the price. No loose threads or, poor craftsmanship + stitching. This is just taking a cheaper quality blend material and designing into a “sweatshirt” style cut. If, a synthetic thin top is what your looking for- This may be for you.. but, unfortunately- not for me.

"Super sweet and Super clever! This is a fun twist on “a matching bracelet set.” Plus, something PIPITREE has addressed quite well.. And that is create a style of jewelry that is made for BOTH genders alike!<br /><br />Many of these “matching combos” miss the mark! So, be sure to take into account the aesthetics of the jewelry and who is receiving it while choosing! It needs to be pleasing to male/female. If not- it’s a bust and a classic example of why “matching couples jewelry” can morph into “couples keychains” instead!!<br /><br />Sizing fits! These can adjust by the slip of their knots. Ohh, and can be put on using one hand. These could go in h2o BUT.. I wouldn’t recommend!! silver charms will tarnish/discolor- water speeds up that process..  So, slip off before you shower, swim, etc!<br /><br />Engraving is tiny, delicate and legible!! Mine includes two languages and a shape. I love that- Silver bead can twist showing its various sides.. and 2 beads placed together, they make a “whole/complete” charm. Aahh..!!<br /><br />**The most clever touch is the tiny magnet charm. Seriously, if holding hands these magnets connect and it’s the cutest thing ever..!! Whatever bracelet says or looks like,  this is the winning factor.

"Wanted to love these from the moment I saw the photo but, either that beautiful young lady wearing these pants has been hand fit and given the appropriate size- bc, that sizing cannot happen using the Sizing chart reference provided!!<br /><br />I followed all the steps and measurements and even erred on the side too of big vs. small! Well… I’m here to tell you the data given is not realistic or compatible to these pants- Ordered sz. L and for reference I was trying to fit 5’5”, 155, 30” waist.. with a rolled cuff if length was too long- these didn’t fit through the waist- AT ALL!! Not if anyone wanted to breathe and wear them! The cut through the hips with adequate did not present or appear in any way like the photograph… And what is so frustrating, we have been on a hunt for a parent just like this!! Who knew it would prove so difficult..Not if anyone wanted to breathe and wear them! The cut through the hips with adequate did not present or appear in any way like the photograph… And what is so frustrating, we have been on a hunt for a parent just like this!! Who knew it would prove so difficult..<br /><br />Material used is lighter in weight but, not airy like I had hoped or, as photographed. It feels to be a mix between a casual cotton and a synthetic athletic substance- which doesn’t allow for the comfort or pant to hang right or give the desired look.<br /><br />I gave this to start for the construction of the pant itself. It seems to be made of solid construction- I also think it may fit the most obscure of sizes.. and therefore gave a second star for the possibility that it could look good on some- it just clearly missed the mark for us. The only way for this parent to be more successful is a better size/fit chart that actually matches the specific item.. along with, photographs that better depict actual appearance of the pants when worn.

"I really wanted to love these… I have a set in sterling silver and they are difficult being so soft and delicate! I was hoping this hinge/metal clasp would make things better.. hoping is key word!!<br /><br />• Metal is dinghy looking, right out of the package! I wish I could attach a photo to explain.. but, there is no bright/new silver look at all!! Instead you get the  “owned these a while and just left them in and forgot about them look.”<br />•I LOVED the idea of this clasp.. sort of flip up and spring/pop back into place. But, it doesn’t function that way… The pair I already own, you must tuck one end inside the other- and it’s not easy.. SSilver can bend when trying to close. Seeing this was a trigger shut- that would pull open, put in ear and it would naturally close, aligning the 2 ends.. NoPe! This too makes you “tuck” in just the very end, which is nice.. Except, this wants to open up on its own- all the time!<br />• Unless, you have skinny/thin or, a “close to the edge” piercing… These struggle to fit around the ear cuff at all! (If that makes sense?!) Not a chance at all of making the smallest fit. The other 2 sizes will just depend on each individual + your piercing placement as well as, thickness of outer ear cuff.<br /><br />• Lastly, keep in mind these are gauged fatter then, a standard earring post! I’ve had ears piercing in ears x30yr. and rarely struggle to fit a post into the hole- With these, I had to force it.. and actually only got it to fit in one side. IF, changing hearing from a stud or if, you uses gauges- this may not be an issue.. but, be aware- these are fatter then, a reg. standard gauged earring post!<br /><br />Sorry to say just “did not likes-“ I realize, these could work/fit for some. Take note: these are standard earring size and will need special caveat to make them work. For that I gave it one star and also, one for the price point.<br />I’m telling you.. Whoever makes a great self closing hoop it step sizes.. that is easy to close and stay that way.. and designed in a standard gauge size.. They will hit the mother load! I found its much harder to locate then, one thinks.. and I’ve tried a handful. For now, I’ll keep looking..<br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",2,0.028,0.85,0.122,0.9921,positive
"Wowza! Are you kidding me..?!! This is almost too classy to be a toiletry bag.. it is classy and sexy, 100%. Boom- mic. drop.. it’s just that great!!<br /><br />Opening the bag you can smell the leather like a brand new horse saddle and personally- I was shocked! Every ounce of this is classy. I’m so looking forward to giving this to my husband who does a lot of business travel.. and has a birthday next week.<br /><br />This has two zipper compartments on either side.. making organization simple and easy. I love the fact you can separate products into two sides. One side for dry items such as: cologne bottle/tooth brush/medications.. the flip side: shaving gear/ shampoo/deodorant.  The separation will keep things neat and tidy. This is soft sided and leather shows a bit of a worn-in look. The inside is lined with a nice fabric- the handle and zipper pulls are made of same quality leather.<br /><br />For the price point, you are getting a top quality and very usable toiletry bag… This makes for a great gift that I’m certain will be loved by the recipient. Being genuine leather.. this should last for years to come! Hands down I recommend!!<br />Hope this info. helps.. feel free to let me know!",5,0.01,0.779,0.212,0.9925,positive
"This is a really awesome, sleek and sexy ring. This has the simplistic style of a mans solid band- yet, comes with a new modern edginess to it.. I really liked a lot!<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant that the cobalt blue would appear cheesy and “bubblegum cheap” however, it’s the cobalt blue that I like the best about this. This has a silver stripe thru the middle.. and the stripe is cut into ring (imbedded) or, “canal” style. This makes the ring stand out a lot more and does so, in such a classy way.. This does not disappoint! note: my 17yr old decided against a high school class ring as, the $$ was too steep for 2yr. of use. (Let’s face it..class rings are super cool when in school- but, post graduation it gets shelved. That is if, it hadn’t been lost yet?!!)<br />So, in Leui of class ring- we chose this tungsten ring for him and he was smitten! (Best part of all?! Bet you can’t guess his school colors.. Yep! You got it.. Cobalt blue/Silver!!) **Hack: anyone looking for an alternative idea to a class ring… Regardless of matching the color, this ring does a nice job of filling the void with something unique and nice to wear/own.<br />As for comfort, The edges are finished smoothly with a soft comfort fit and the attention to detail has not been overlooked. I really like how this has been smoothed for wearing comfort.. Yet, the ring itself still keeps very defined straight edges and lines. (I feel rounded/sloped edges have a wedding band look ..and this was not what I wanted. Especially for my 17yr old high schooler!) **note:<br />I realize some rings can be unisex..(most days I prefer men’s band due to the width.) Sure! this could be worn by either.. BuT, I do feel this has a total masculine vibe to it- just FYI!!<br /><br />As for tungsten? it has worn fantastically with no scratches/dings. My son is involved in some active classes ie, Weight training, stage tech, PE class.. all causing wear and tear in/on the hands. After a week plus of wearing.. I don’t see a single scuff! I also expected because of weights class, the pressure used in the hand would have bent or, misshaped the ring to his grip.. Nope! this is, rock solid just like it arrived.<br />For anyone considering this ring- I am 100% impressed and would say, it will not disappoint. This comes in a standard flip top ring box ready to gift or, store.. definitely a ring that will last a long time!",5,0.036,0.784,0.18,0.9963,positive
"Gorgeous!! This is a stunning gold ring with an awesome insert made of royal blue- Wow! My son who’s a teen and just now, getting into the wearing of jewelry- wanted a ring he could wear everyday.. this is perfect for that. Now, he is just torn between wearing on his finger.. or, on a chain- which he loves that look so, you can see the royal blue interior..!!<br />I loved the trendy but, unique look to this ring- being this is worn by a teenage boy who wanted a ring, just a ring that is not 100% wedding ring only- and well, that is a bit hard to find! I will say after seeing this in person... it is nice! Nice enough to wear without looking like a bubblegum ring- it is solid material and it’s great bc, this metal/finish doesn’t scratch. I love the fact he can use to do whatever activity and not muck up the ring... A lot of men’s wedding rings can’t even make this claim. My husband has to get his ring buffed out from time to time.. and trust me, its a quality 24kt gold from the fancy jewelers!<br /><br />If someone is in the market for a ring to cover the void in the wedding band department- this could be a perfect “fill in!” TBH- Not sure if it would have the longevity of a “life long” everyday wedding ring..?! But, we all know that there are reasons, needs and times when .. not wearing your real wedding ring is a must. Bam! This would definitely be a good supplement and fill the void of a wedding ring or, be a great “body double!” -And for this use, it would look the part and not fail at its job. (Honest- I equate this to a solid sterling silver ring for women without the softness of ss. .. so, I’m here to say, tungsten is pretty sick!)<br />The ring is really sharp looking- The use of a quick polish cloth can make it shine like new and we’ve kept this on while snow sledding.. weight lifting and even hanging in the hot tub one night!",5,0.034,0.782,0.184,0.9963,positive
"I like the concept and size of the bag For a small purse, it’s especially nice when caring a regular style purse is not conducive to the activity. This has two separate pockets that are easily accessible and the bag fits everything a small purse would. Problem is, the straps on the back are far from workable!! These “streamers” are way too distracting and keep me from loving the bag..<br /><br />What am I talking about or referring too..???<br />Issue: these adjustable Straps obviously have to have excess length to accommodate the different size users- But, these hang beyond too long once you adjust the length to an appropriate and proper shoulder length and I’m referring to the adjustments to fit an adult- on a small child, this issue would be worse!.. it’s like two long “tails” hanging down off each shoulder! Conundrum: when it arrives- each strap has been nicely sewn and finished so, they won’t fray or, run. Yet, if you were to cut off the excess strap .. and by excess, after an adult 5’7” adjusts the backpack to fit loosely on her shoulders- there are approx. 10” of excess strap on each side hanging down ... if I cut these, the ends will unravel- most likely causing more of an unsavory look to the bag.<br /><br />The material feels durable and the construction in other places seems quite adequate… Zipper is easily open/closed- and has small flap to cover keeping it from getting snagged. It just seems very basic no-frills straightforward I’m not disappointed in the bag itself.. just not really wowed either! And the straps Would deter me from future purchase.",3,0.057,0.837,0.106,0.9288,positive
"Fun jacket definitely made for Junior women’s sizing -the cut is shorter in hits at the waist. This zips up the front and is a tad tight in the chest area. Ordered a large for my 18yr old daughter who is 5‘6“ -137lb, 36C and usually fits a large just fine.. again, loved the cut- just wish it had more room thru chest.  The arm length is adequate and Quality seems quite decent in Craftsmanship.<br /><br />This is down alternative- It is lightweight in the fill and therefore… Great for fall or warmer winter days. I would not recommend for winter sports or,<br />subzero temp.’s! It is light enough to pack into suitcase.. NO! it does not come with a pouch to it pack in but, it can condense quite small... any small bag will help contain it while traveling-<br />Ordered the red/black print.. and tbh, I was a little nervous to say the least.

"Ok- major error I guess on my part.. but, so others don’t make my same mistake- Lurex is a sparkly tinsel like thread that is sewn into the actual hat.. and I didn’t know or, expect it.<br />Bigger issue- this was intended for a teenage boy!! The actual hat it’s self is made quite nice which is also disappointing because, I’m looking for this exact tighter fitted KNIT style hat. A lot on the market seem to be Knitted- only end up loose fitting and bulky. Or, one can find a fitted knit hat but, it totally misses the mark as it resembles the look of a burglar or else, It’s made of fleece! Exactly what I’m trying to avoid and why my interest in this particular hat - This hat has a soft texture and seems like quality material and crafting- no loose threads, straight seams and really nice attention to detail. The best of all, it fits your head without the extra 1” of nothing left at the top.. or, the 3” roll of the outer brim- just to size it right. So, for anyone in need of a sparkly hat- this is a great choice!<br />One last thing to add.. the hat to me seems very seasonal or festive! Which could be nice as we are coming right into the holiday season... it’s definitely made for a female audience with a Christmas/new year’s vibe for sure! Not sure how but, I missed women’s in the description.. So be aware, not all hats are created equal!! I tend to think of a beanie hat as unisex... nope!",3,0.084,0.727,0.189,0.9891,positive
"Wow! What a good looking and sexy belt.. This is such a high quality- from the moment you open the package.. it gives off a smell of new leather and that’s a perk! (Some items can have a yuck chemical smell when arriving making you question what it’s really made of...lot, where. not this!!)<br />The thickness is perfect- it easily fits standard belt loop on pants or slacks.. Yet, its sturdy enough to lend its support, in keeping pants up/holding things in. The buckle is brushed silver and easy to maneuver.. we did need to add one extra hole for the perfect comfort while wearing- and with the leather being a soft and pliable quality.. we did this, no problem. The stitching is  very precise as well as the cut edges (I think we’re all familiar with a cheap belt that begins to shed “string layers” on the outer cut edge of the belt...?) well, this is finished with quality 360’ of the item.<br />This was for an adult male: 6’4”, 205lb., 36x36<br />The belt size ordered was a 36... and that is the only issue seen… Only the last hole on the belt would fit comfortably on a male with a true 36” waist giving the reason for adding an additional hole! I realize as this belt wears and stretches- it may need to be tightened to a smaller hole.. and that would be no problem, there are plenty of options if you’re on the smaller end of the size 36 belt. My suggestion- if unsure or hesitant on sizing, you are best to size up!!<br />**i definitely want to add- this belt would be equally perfect for a female as well. I realize it is thicker width then, standard skinny women’s belts- but, If you prefer a thicker style.. this is a great option.<br />Overall, this is a classy looking belt. So, if looking for something that is quality constructed to last and looks good as it’s doing it- this is a great choice! Definitely can be used to dress up/down.",5,0.036,0.794,0.17,0.9928,positive

So one size really fits 2-12, with the upper and lower extremes being a less ideal fit.<br />The material is super soft, but it is also very thin.

"These aren't the same material as the non-maternity Felina leggings. They aren't the butter material or the cotton material. They are thicker than both. The texture is similar to the cotton ones, but they are much stretchier. The belly panel is made of much thinner/stretchier material. I purchased a size larger than my normal Felina legging size because I was worried they'd be too uncomfortable snug on my belly. I'm entering the last weeks of pregnancy and everything feels terrible. Because of the thinness and super stretch in the belly, I didn't really need to size up.

"Minnesota is notorious for its mosquitos and I got a reviewer hat in perfect time for trying to find mushrooms.  In fact a week before it arrived, I got chased out of the woods by horse flies, so I was super excited to head back out armed with this hat.  And it did prove to work for the most part.  Aided with long sleeves and long pants I could wade through the swarms and look for mushrooms, but the screen ended up being a hinderance in being able to see mushrooms on the forest floor so I ended up pulling it up a lot.  In the end, the search was still a failure, but a far more comfortable failure.<br /><br />We also took it on a weekend trip to the bourndary waters and it served well enough during the twilight hours.  It is lightweight, reasonably one size fits all and interestingly designed.  I like that the net tucks into the zippered pouch on the top of the head and, while I would not want my high school crush to see me wearing it, it looks ok.  It definitely feels rugged enough to last us for the rest of our mosquito needs.  All in all, we like it, but it is still annoying enough that we can't love it.

"Jumpsuits are a great way to look put together without much effort. The fabric is soft and very stretchy like a t-shirt. There's a tie at the waist that is purely decorative. If you have a shorter torso, you can fold the fabric at the waist and cover it with a belt. The fit is true to size. For reference, I'm 5'6"", 162lbs and a 34G bra size.

"I like the colorful print of this dress and the summery style. The problem is that the fabric is very thin and kind of cheap looking. It has just the tiniest hint of stretch. You can pretty much see through it in bright light. The fit runs small. I would have sized up had I read the fabric details. For reference, I'm 5'6"", 162lbs and a 34G bra size.

"They had me at Meghan Markle. These sunnies are really cute. They add a touch of class to any outfit. The shape is just shy of a true cat eye. They're very ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".

"These pants really nice. Unfortunately, I received two sizes smaller than what I requested. When you read that they're merino wool, you think thick. They're actually super lightweight.

"Leopard print is an instant mood lifter for me. This dress would have been perfect if it had been longer. The fabric is lightweight and stretchy. The scoop neckline is flattering on curves. There is a high waistline that is accented by ruching down the side of the dress. The front hem has a tulip opening. The overall look is very cute, but the hem was just too short for comfort.

This robe will instantly transport you to a luxury spa...in your head. The fabric is ultra plush and super soft. It's the ULTIMATE in cozy comfort. The length is down to the ankle and there's enough room to truly wrap yourself up. The hood is an added benefit. You may find yourself wanting to wear this robe everywhere.

"I think this skirt would have been great, but the zipper is too short. You need a couple extra inches so that the fabric opens up enough to slide the skirt over your hips. I compared this skirt to a US size 12. The measurements are about the same in the waist and hips. The problem is that it will be hard for most people to get the skirt past their hips because the zipper limits how far the skirt can open. The size chart is accurate when it comes to measurements. I think that if you really like the skirt, you can have a new zipper professionally installed. The zipper on the front is just for show. The other thing is that the belt is kind of useless because the notches are so far from the buckle. With a few small changes, this could be a cute skirt. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"" and 153lbs. I wear either a 10 or 12 in skirts. The 2XL would have fit fine if not for the zipper.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

"This dress is very modest, but has great style. The fabric is lightweight and has stretch. There's an elasticized waistband for definition. You can add a belt for cinching. The top has a slight batwing effect. The nice part is that the lining goes up to the armpit, so you don't show your underpinnings when you raise your arms. The maxi length is comfortable and very easy to wear. I think the sizing is closer to a 12/14 than a 14/16. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I usually wear a size 10.

"This dress would have been perfect if it had been lined. Due to the sheerness of chiffon, the side panels are sheer in bright light.

I'd say that this is closer to a US size 12. I usually wear a 10, sometimes a 12 if I need extra room on top. This dress was big in the waist, but fit everywhere else.

"I fell in love with this dress as soon as I tried it on. The print gives it a designer look. The maxi length means you don't need to shave. The fabric is lightweight and has stretch. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice, depending on your waist size. I found the sizing to run small. I usually wear a 10 in most dresses unless I need extra room on top. This dress fit me very well, though it was a little large in the waist. I would say a size 12 or a smaller 14 could fit the X-Large size.

"I would have really liked this jumpsuit if it hadn't been for the lining. It's like a built-in pair of shorts. Because the fabric is so lightweight, you can clearly see the lining. It looks like a white pair of Spanx. It's not a flattering look. Either there should be no lining or a full-length one. Other than that, the fabric is a gauzy material with no stretch.

"A good robe is a necessity, in my opinion. This one features a soft, lightweight fabric that works for all seasons. There's a nice waffle texture that adds to the overall style. The robe isn't attached when you take it out of the package, so make sure not to accidentally throw it away. There are no ties on the inside as a backup, but the belt does stay securely closed. The deep green color is more of a teal as pictured. The fit runs small. I chose the X-Large. It fits more like a medium/large. I would have gone up one more size for full coverage.

"I've seen invisible bras like this all over Instagram. I wondered if they'd actually work for large, heavy ""girls"". I'm absolutely SHOCKED that they do. First off, I'm a G cup. They were given to me by my mom, not a doctor. They're heavy and unruly, so I didn't think these things would work. Granted, these cups are a size small for me, but they lifted and stayed put. There are no instructions, so it may take a couple tries to get the placement right. Also, you want to make sure that the application area hasn't been moisturized to improve adhesion. You may want to use a little spray antiperspirant if you think you might sweat. Also, keep the plastic backing so you can place them back on the cups for storage. The surface is smooth like a t-shirt bra, so you can wear them under most fabrics. I really hope the seller makes these available in a G/H cup. I'd buy several pairs.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

"This dress could have been great, but the snaps kind of ruin it. There are snaps down the side that keep the dress closed. As you can see from my picture, the fabric pulls at the snaps. This picture was taken after a few minutes of trying to stretch the fabric to improve how it looks. There's also a weird belt that doesn't go all the way around the waist. If you try to tighten it, the pulling at the snaps gets worse. I probably would have had to go up two sizes for the fabric to fall properly, but then it would have been too big in the waist. On the positive side, the fabric is very nice.

There's good support for the mid-foot to make it appropriate for jogging or cycling. The fabric wasn't as soft as I'd prefer, but that's just my personal taste.",4,0.02,0.836,0.143,0.9072,positive

"I selected this ring set on a whim. This is the kind of set that is well-suited for someone who is pursuing a Goth lifestyle or for someone who enjoys a bit of flash. This is an interesting set with some really neat designs. However, not all of the rings in this set are adjustable as the listing suggests.<br /><br />There are 9 rings in this set, all of which have been polished to a shine and the crevices filled with black to make them contrast very well. There’s an interesting assortment of designs – a couple of dragons, claws, snakes and tentacles, and even a sugar skull. In spite of the amount of metal, these really aren’t all that heavy and do not weigh you down even when you wear all of them on one hand. They do have enough shape to them that they can easily catch on clothes but that’s a different discussion.<br /><br />Of the 9 rings in this set, the two largest – a dragon and a sugar skull – are made such that they cannot be adjusted. In the case of those two, they have an unbroken loop that prevents bending and stretching them open more, and that’s a problem if you have larger hands. My ring size is big – I wear a 13 – so these two rings just will not fit properly, even on my pinky finger.<br /><br />The other rings in this set are all open loops and the metal used is soft enough that these can be gently pried open or pushed closed to fit better. They will not bend without deliberate effort.<br /><br />These look great. Some attention was expended on detail and make these look a bit more expensive than they are.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice set. All of these rings are made well and they look really nice. It is unfortunate that not all of them can be adjusted, though most can with gentle but deliberate effort.",4,0.044,0.832,0.123,0.9769,positive
"I typically do not wear watches, though when I do it has typically been the less expensive kind that you can find in a department store. My usual limit for spending on a watch has usually been about $35. Burei watches are a lot nicer than what I usually wear but they are not astronomically priced. I have seen several Burei watches and this one has emerged as my favorite so far. It fits me beautifully and it looks very elegant and sophisticated.<br /><br />This watch has gone with a simplistic approach in design – not too cluttered and concentrate on doing things right. I have had this watch for a week and it has kept perfect time so far, though to be fair it takes months before you can tell if a watch is keeping or losing time. The face has the three basic hands: hours, minutes and seconds. It also has a small dial that tells the hour in 24-hour format. At first I thought this was strictly decorative, but it actually does work and the small hand on it moves through the day.<br /><br />The face has a cut-out where you can see a small portion of the inner workings. For a better look, take a peek at the back of the watch, though the inner gears are not all that visible regardless.<br /><br />This is a self-winding watch and through the window on the back you can see the weight that winds the watch as you move. So, while there is no battery to replace, it does mean that if you do not wear the watch for a while it will eventually stop.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with the majority of watches I have tried is that they usually do not fit me very well at all. They are either too tight even on the largest setting or I can’t get them to fit at all. This watch has a very generous metal band that fits me nearly perfectly. When closed, and without removing any of the links, the band has enough play in it to allow the watch to move a little bit but not so much that it turns from the top of my wrist. I have huge hands and large wrists so this is not going to work for a lot of people but in the package is a tool for removing links so you can adjust the band to fit properly.<br /><br />Finally, this is an absolutely beautiful watch. I have received many, many compliments from people when they see it and they ask me about it.<br /><br />This is a wonderful luxury watch, more upscale than what you will find in a department store and nowhere near as expensive as some of the more expensive brands like Rado or Tag. There are two important considerations when buying a more expensive watch: does it fit and does it keep time. For me, this watch does both and I am very satisfied with it. The fact that it is very attractive is a bonus.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"[[VIDEOID:d2988928d234f06a0c891dc9df76e75]] I am usually very hesitant to buy clothes for my wife because I will either get the size wrong, the color wrong, the style wrong or some combination of those three. A scarf is a safe bet, though, so I selected this scarf with the intention of giving it to her as a surprise. It is a nicer scarf than I expected.<br /><br />This is a cashmere-blend scarf that is made of some of the softest material I have ever felt in an article of clothing, even softer than a fleece blanket which should say a lot. It has a texture similar to wool but without the scratchiness and without the distinct smell that comes with wool (I like that smell but it's very unique). The tassels are all about 3” long and are all along the short edge.<br /><br />Unfolded and stretched out this scarf is a little over 2' wide and is about 7' long.<br /><br />In addition to being so soft, it's well made too. I have found no blemishes in the material and no nits, pills or cuts. The stitching is tight and straight.<br /><br />This is not an expensive scarf but is far and away better than I hoped. It is exceptionally soft and very nicely made. For once I just might make some points with my wife for picking out clothing for her.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

"Most bags and backpacks I see available anymore are made of nylon or polyester blends and while they look nice initially and are easy to clean they have a bad tendency to wear quickly and fall apart. I remember canvas bags when I was young that lasted for years. This backpack/laptop bag is the first canvas bag I have seen in years and it is well made and is very large - most excellent for a college student going to classes or a hiker spending time in the mountains.<br /><br />To get a fair idea of the size I decided to stuff this bag as full as I could. I was able to cram in two full-sized inflated basketballs and two junior-sized inflated basketballs, and I still had a little more room in the main compartment of the bag. This is a really large-capacity bag and is roomy enough to accommodate a week’s worth of clothes, some sporting equipment or a good many college textbooks and a laptop. I have not used a laptop backpack that has come close to being this roomy before now.<br /><br />There are a good number of pockets inside and outside this bag. In the main compartment is a divider for securing a larger laptop but there is also a zippered pouch that’s ideal for pencils, pens, a mouse, power cords or other smaller instruments. It’s probably the most protected area of this bag and would be a good way to stash a mobile phone safely. There is a second small pouch on the inside that is divided up for pencils, pens and other small items. There are three exterior pockets as well, all of which are about the same size as the interior zippered pocket.<br /><br />What is interesting about the exterior pockets is the fact that they have snaps and buckles, but the buckles are decorative and are actually held closed by magnets. So, there is never a need to fiddle with the buckles at all - just pull on them and they easily pull free from the magnets. There is a flap that closes the main compartment as well and this is also held closed by magnets disguised as buckles.<br /><br />The main compartment can also be closed via a draw string inside, providing a little extra security for the items inside.<br /><br />The whole bag is real canvas, not some polyester/nylon weave. I looked this bag over and found no loose threads, no uneven stitching and nothing loose or out of place.<br /><br />This bag lacks only one thing - a reinforced bottom, which would be helpful if the bag is going to be used for heavier loads for a long period of time. I have no reason to believe that the stitching or canvas will fail, but it would be reassuring to have a leather base or an extra layer of canvas to reinforce. This is by no means a deal-breaker and is still the largest and most well-constructed bag I have used.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that there is no protection for a laptop in this bag and I have to agree to a point. The emphasis on this bag was construction and strength, not padding and protection. So, if using with a laptop be careful when setting the bag down.<br /><br />This is arguably the best bag I have seen and used in many years for laptops or just as a generalized book bag. It is very large, has plenty of pockets and seems to be made well. It is not perfect but it is closer than most.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.
